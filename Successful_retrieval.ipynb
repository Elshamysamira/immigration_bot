      "With the unprecedented increase in our commercial activities has come\n",
      "a demand for better business methods. Methods which were adequate for\n",
      "the business of a less active commercial era, have given way to systems\n",
      "and labor-saving ideas in keeping with the financial and industrial\n",
      "progress of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of this progress has risen a new literature--the literature of\n",
      "business. But with the rapid advancement in the science of business,\n",
      "its literature can scarcely be said to have kept pace, at least, not to\n",
      "the same extent as in other sciences and professions. Much excellent\n",
      "material dealing with special phases of business activity has been\n",
      "prepared, but this is so scattered that the student desiring to acquire\n",
      "a comprehensive business library has found himself confronted by\n",
      "serious difficulties. He has been obliged, to a great extent, to make\n",
      "his selections blindly, resulting in many duplications of material\n",
      "without securing needed information on important phases of the subject.\n",

      "=1.= If the old axiom, \"Goods well bought are half sold,\" holds true,\n",
      "the purchasing department may well be considered one of the most\n",
      "important in any business. In referring to the purchasing department\n",
      "we have in mind that department, or division of the business, whose\n",
      "duty it is to attend to the buying. In a large industrial enterprise\n",
      "this may mean a department headed by a purchasing agent with several\n",
      "assistants; in a department store, the buyers for the several\n",
      "departments; in a small retail business, the member of the firm who\n",
      "buys the goods. No matter whether the department be an extensive one,\n",
      "or one requiring but a part of the time of one man, the principle is\n",
      "the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps no other head of a department has greater need of complete\n",
      "information and systematic records of his department, than does the\n",
      "buyer. A man may have every qualification for a successful purchasing\n",
      "agent, but, unless he has the most detailed information to aid him in\n",
      "judging qualities and prices, his cannot be considered a successful\n",
      "department. On the other hand, many a man, with no other qualification\n",
      "than common sense, has built up a most successful purchasing department\n",
      "because his work was thoroughly systematized.\n",
      "\n",
      "We will consider the purchasing department from two standpoints: The\n",
      "_information required_, and the _routine work_ to be performed. Under\n",
      "the first head the requirements may be stated as:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. List of dealers.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Full information about lines carried by each dealer or manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. Records of special quotations.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. Information about qualities supplied by various dealers, to be\n",
      " obtained from records of past purchases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "LIST OF DEALERS\n",
      "\n",
      "=2.= The purchasing agent will have no difficulty in securing a list of\n",
      "dealers. Even a new business is usually well supplied with circulars,\n",
      "catalogues, and other information showing which dealers handle certain\n",
      "lines. The principal concern of the purchasing agent is to so record\n",
      "this information that it will be instantly available.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some cases it is found necessary to make special lists of dealers,\n",
      "and these are usually made on cards. A card is used for each article or\n",
      "class of material that may be of interest, and the name of the class\n",
      "is written at the top of the card. Below this are listed the names and\n",
      "addresses of dealers and manufacturers supplying that particular class\n",
      "of material. Since in most concerns this information can be combined\n",
      "with the system of catalogue indexing, we do not show a special form\n",
      "for this record.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CATALOGUE FILING AND INDEXING\n",
      "\n",
      "=3.= A purchasing agent must necessarily gather much of the information\n",
      "required in the operation of his department from catalogues supplied\n",
      "by manufacturers. These catalogues are his technical library, in many\n",
      "cases supplying the only available information relative to a particular\n",
      "class of goods. Needless to say, some method must be provided for\n",
      "carefully preserving these catalogues. They must be filed in such a\n",
      "manner that they can be located quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "While every office has plenty of opportunities to accumulate an\n",
      "oversupply of catalogues, resulting in a tendency to discard all except\n",
      "those in which the purchasing agent may be interested at the time, it\n",
      "is better to err on the side of a liberal supply. A catalogue that\n",
      "comes in to-day may be of no immediate value, but it may become useful\n",
      "a little later. It would be impracticable to keep every catalogue and\n",
      "circular that reaches the office, but, if it is from a new concern, or\n",
      "offers any new ideas, it should be kept, even though the subject is not\n",
      "of especial interest at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many systems of catalogue filing have been devised, and there are\n",
      "almost as many styles of catalogue files on the market as there are\n",
      "manufacturers of such equipment. No one system or style of filing will\n",
      "answer the requirements in every concern. Each must build up a filing\n",
      "system that will conform to existing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though a system of universal application cannot be laid down, some\n",
      "general suggestions may prove of value. No matter what the style\n",
      "of receptacle used, catalogues are filed according to one of two\n",
      "methods: The _alphabetical_, or the _numerical_. The alphabetical\n",
      "method consists in the arrangement of catalogues in bookcases or other\n",
      "suitable devices, according to the names of the publishers. For a\n",
      "small number of catalogues, this is a very satisfactory system, for\n",
      "the very reason that a purchasing agent soon becomes familiar with the\n",
      "catalogues of different manufacturers, recognizing them by their size,\n",
      "shape, or color.\n",
      "\n",
      "A modification of the alphabetical system is one in which the\n",
      "catalogues are arranged alphabetically by classes; that is, the lines\n",
      "of goods in which the purchasing agent is interested are divided into\n",
      "specific classes. In each of these divisions, the catalogues of all\n",
      "manufacturers listing that class of goods are arranged in alphabetical\n",
      "order. This method is also very satisfactory for a limited number of\n",
      "catalogues.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a large catalogue file the numerical system will prove the most\n",
      "satisfactory. By this system each catalogue is given a number which\n",
      "should be plainly shown on the back of the catalogue. All catalogues\n",
      "of a specific class are placed in one group, and a series of numbers\n",
      "is set aside for the group. To illustrate, we might have machinery\n",
      "catalogues, numbers 1 to 100. All machinery catalogues would then be\n",
      "given a number in that series. If the number be increased beyond 100,\n",
      "the numbering system would be repeated by using 1_a_, 2_a_, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the numerical system, the catalogues of each group must be\n",
      "arranged in exact numerical order, so that any catalogue may be\n",
      "instantly located.\n",
      "\n",
      "=4. Files.= As has already been stated, the style of file, as well as\n",
      "the method of filing, or indexing, must conform to the conditions in\n",
      "each individual office. However, the experience of the past is the\n",
      "best guide for the future. As a general rule, sectional bookcases\n",
      "will be found the most satisfactory for catalogues in bound form,\n",
      "that is, those with substantial covers, and particularly those that\n",
      "will readily stand on edge. An advantage of the sectional bookcase is\n",
      "that all catalogues can plainly be seen, and even though a numerical\n",
      "system be used, a man soon learns to recognize catalogues of certain\n",
      "manufacturers without referring to any number or indexing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every catalogue file will be found pamphlets, circulars, and\n",
      "price lists which are not easily cared for in bookcases. For these\n",
      "a section of a vertical file is recommended, and in many cases this\n",
      "file has been used successfully for filing all sorts of miscellaneous\n",
      "catalogues. It may be expanded to any capacity, and can be used with\n",
      "equal success for either the alphabetical or numerical system of\n",
      "indexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is the better depends upon the circumstances, but in nearly every\n",
      "case either the sectional bookcase or the vertical file, or perhaps a\n",
      "combination of the two, will be found most satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "=5. Catalogue Indexing.= The principal value of a file of catalogues\n",
      "lies in the index. A miscellaneous lot of catalogues is of very little\n",
      "value unless it be properly indexed. True, most catalogues contain an\n",
      "index, but this is not the sort of index required by the purchasing\n",
      "agent. He does not care for an itemized list of every article\n",
      "manufactured by John Jones & Co., but he does want an index that will\n",
      "show him where he can find descriptions and prices of machines of a\n",
      "certain class. A catalogue may list thousands of articles in which the\n",
      "purchasing agent has no interest, where it lists ten that are of use to\n",
      "him. These ten articles are the ones which should be shown in his index.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 1. Subject Card for Catalogue Index]\n",
      "\n",
      "The principal index of the catalogue file is one arranged by subjects.\n",
      "A card used for this purpose is shown in Fig. 1. At the top of the card\n",
      "is listed the subject. Below this is given the names and addresses of\n",
      "all manufacturers supplying the goods listed. In the columns at the\n",
      "right are recorded the section number, catalogue number, and page. The\n",
      "section number refers to the section in the file where the catalogue\n",
      "will be found; the catalogue number to the catalogue itself; and the\n",
      "page to the number of the page in the catalogue. In making up such\n",
      "an index, it is unnecessary to include a long list of articles of no\n",
      "especial interest, but simply those which the concern is obliged to\n",
      "purchase. If an entirely new subject comes up, it can then be listed\n",
      "after suitable investigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "These cards are filed alphabetically, according to the name of the\n",
      "subject. While in some large concerns a more elaborate file will be\n",
      "necessary, this index can usually be kept in a small card tray in a\n",
      "desk drawer.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 2. Title Card for Catalogue Index]\n",
      "\n",
      "When the numerical system of filing is used, another index is necessary\n",
      "to locate the catalogues by name. In most cases our chief concern would\n",
      "be to locate the catalogue by subject, but there are times when it\n",
      "becomes necessary to locate a catalogue by name. To provide for this\n",
      "cross-index, the card shown in Fig. 2 is used. It will be noted that\n",
      "the arrangement of this card is just the opposite of the subject index,\n",
      "the name and address of the manufacturer being given at the top of the\n",
      "card together with the reference to the section and catalogue numbers.\n",
      "On the lower half of the card are listed the names of articles, made by\n",
      "that manufacturer, in which we are interested. This card is also filed\n",
      "alphabetically, but, of course, under the name of the manufacturer.\n",
      "When the number of cards is limited, both forms can be filed in the\n",
      "same index by using contrasting colors. For instance, a buff color\n",
      "might be used for the subject index, and salmon for the name index.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "SPECIAL QUOTATIONS\n",
      "\n",
      "=6.= Every purchasing agent receives, in addition to published price\n",
      "lists, many special quotations on material and supplies in which he is\n",
      "interested. Very frequently quotations are received at a time when he\n",
      "is not in the market for the particular material offered, but they are\n",
      "nevertheless of value for possible future use, and should be carefully\n",
      "preserved.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 3. Card Form for Special Quotations]\n",
      "\n",
      "One method of handling special quotations is to set aside a special\n",
      "file, or a drawer, or a section of the regular file, to be used\n",
      "exclusively for quotations. The quotations, when such a file is used,\n",
      "are usually filed alphabetically according to the name of the material\n",
      "offered. This method of filing necessitates a cross-index to locate the\n",
      "letters by names of firms and is not entirely satisfactory, owing to\n",
      "the difficulty of locating the most advantageous quotations. There may\n",
      "be a dozen or more letters from different firms quoting prices on the\n",
      "same material, and, to find which is the lowest, all must be examined.\n",
      "Again, a firm will make quotations on several lines in the same letter,\n",
      "which necessitates copying a part of the items or reorganizing the\n",
      "filing system.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a business receiving many such quotations, it is advisable to\n",
      "reserve a special file for them, but we recommend their being filed\n",
      "according to the names of firms. To provide an accessible record of\n",
      "special quotations, the use of a special form, either on cards or loose\n",
      "leaves, is recommended. While no form universally applicable can be\n",
      "devised, the several forms herein presented are very good examples of\n",
      "forms in use and offer some valuable points for study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fig. 3 is a conventional form. This is a card, at the top of which\n",
      "is provided space for recording the name of the article or class of\n",
      "material. Below this is a record of all quotations received, giving\n",
      "date, name of the firm from whom the quotation is received, and\n",
      "initials of the salesman making the quotation, when made in this\n",
      "manner. The columns following are for quantity, or size on which the\n",
      "quotation is based, the list price, discount, net, whether f. o. b. or\n",
      "delivered, and terms. The last two columns are for a record of orders\n",
      "placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of these cards is used for each article or class of material on\n",
      "which special quotations are received. Every quotation is recorded,\n",
      "no matter from whom, and when the card is filled a new one is added.\n",
      "Whenever records on any one card become obsolete, the card can be\n",
      "destroyed, keeping the file up to date.\n",
      "\n",
      "The cards are filed according to the names of the articles or classes\n",
      "of material. When the number of classes is limited, it will be\n",
      "satisfactory to index the cards by means of a straight alphabetical\n",
      "index. In this case quotations on bolts and all other articles, the\n",
      "names of which commence with _b_, would be filed back of the _B_\n",
      "index. If the number of articles is large, it is advisable to use\n",
      "blank index guides and write the names of classes of material. As an\n",
      "illustration, in some lines of manufacture, bolts will be used in all\n",
      "sizes. On the index would be written the word _Bolts_, and back of\n",
      "this the cards would be filed according to sizes, one card being used\n",
      "for each size of bolt. The same plan can be carried out for each class\n",
      "of material. It is also advisable, in a manufacturing business, to\n",
      "subdivide the file as, between materials--representing materials which\n",
      "actually enter into the construction of the product manufactured--and\n",
      "supplies--representing all classes of factory supplies.\n",
      "\n",
      "A card especially designed for a record of quotations on articles which\n",
      "are listed in several sizes is shown in Fig. 4. The special feature of\n",
      "this form is the inclusion of several columns in which to record prices\n",
      "on a number of different sizes of the same article. This form would be\n",
      "especially applicable in recording prices on such articles as bolts,\n",
      "mentioned in the preceding paragraph.\n",

      "in the past, prices paid, promptness of delivery, and general character\n",
      "of goods received. A convenient method of recording this information\n",
      "is to use a card similar to the illustration, Fig. 5, which shows a\n",
      "form used for recording purchases of a given article between specified\n",
      "dates. The record itself shows the order number, quantity, name of\n",
      "vendor, and full information about prices, including total cost per\n",

      "\n",
      "=8.= Any discussion of the routine duties of the purchasing department\n",
      "is necessarily more or less theoretical and any method of procedure\n",
      "laid down is subject to such modification as will reduce it to a\n",
      "practical working basis for the individual establishment. To present\n",
      "the subject in a practical manner, therefore, this discussion will be\n",
      "confined to the needs of an average manufacturing business. As has been\n",
      "stated elsewhere in these papers, it is much less difficult to modify a\n",
      "system designed to care for all details in a large establishment than\n",
      "to expand the simple systems of a small business.\n",
      "\n",
      "The duties of the purchasing agent in respect to the actual purchase of\n",
      "goods may be classified as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. Receiving _requisitions_, or orders for materials and supplies\n",
      " required for stock or in different departments.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " 5. Filing order copies and requisitions.\n",
      "\n",
      "=9. Requisitions.= Under ordinary circumstances the purchasing agent\n",
      "will place no orders until he has first received a requisition from\n",
      "either the stores department or the department that requires the\n",
      "material. The requisition should in every case state the purpose for\n",
      "which the material or supplies is required, as well as by whom wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each department should be supplied with its own requisition blanks,\n",
      "and, to make them distinctive, a different color should be adopted for\n",
      "each department. Each department should also be identified by a letter\n",
      "which will be printed on the requisition blank in connection with a\n",
      "serial number. Thus the requisition numbers of one department will\n",
      "start with _A_1, another _B_1, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "A positive rule should be laid down that all requisitions issued by one\n",
      "department are to be signed by one person, usually the foreman. This\n",
      "rule must be rigidly enforced and no requisitions honored without the\n",
      "proper signature.\n",
      "\n",
      "While requisitions should be drafted in a form to meet individual\n",
      "requirements, Fig. 10 is given as a typical example that will be found\n",
      "suitable in a large majority of offices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The requisition, as a rule, is made in duplicate. The original goes\n",
      "to the purchasing agent and the duplicate is retained by the foreman.\n",
      "In some of the larger establishments a triplicate form is used,\n",
      "the original and duplicate being sent to the purchasing agent. The\n",
      "duplicate is then returned to the foreman with proper notations to show\n",
      "that the order has been placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are very few cases, however, where this is necessary. It is\n",
      "not a good plan to require the foreman to keep records that can be\n",
      "eliminated, and the average foreman does not care when or where the\n",
      "order is placed; all he wants is the material. He has no interest in\n",
      "going back of the purchasing agent on whom he has made requisition.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the factory is located at a distance from the office, requisitions\n",
      "should be in triplicate and bear the O. K. of the superintendent or\n",
      "factory manager. The duplicate will then be filed in the factory office\n",

      "copies until the material is received.\n",
      "\n",
      "On receipt of the requisition, the purchasing agent first investigates\n",
      "to find if the material, or some other that will answer the same\n",
      "purpose, is in stock. If not, he looks up his sources of supply\n",
      "and prices, and then he is ready to place the order. When a large\n",
      "investment is involved, it is usually necessary to obtain special\n",
      "quotations, and sometimes samples, before the order can be placed.\n",
      "\n",
      "=10. Low Stock Report.= Another form of requisition is the low stock\n",
      "report furnished by the stores clerk. Every article and class of\n",
      "material in stock is given a _low_ limit. When this limit is reached\n",
      "the stores clerk makes a report, Fig. 11, to the purchasing agent. This\n",
      "is recognized as a notice to purchase. The report shows the low limit\n",
      "and quantity in stock. It is important that the low limit be included,\n",
      "for in some cases it will be found advisable to change the limit.\n",
      "Material formerly used in large quantities may now be in so little\n",
      "demand that it will be thought best to reduce the limit. At other times\n",
      "it will be necessary to increase the limit.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 11. The Stores Clerk's Report of Low Stock]\n",
      "\n",
      "The report is made in duplicate, a copy being retained by the stores\n",
      "clerk until advised that the order has been placed. There is no special\n",
      "need for keeping these reports permanently; all information that they\n",
      "would supply may be had from copies of purchase orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "=11. Purchase Orders.= When an order is placed, it is of course\n",
      "necessary to keep one or more copies. The best practice is to make\n",
      "purchase orders in manifold, providing as many copies as may be\n",
      "required. Modern typewriters and carbon paper render it possible to\n",
      "make all necessary copies at one writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The number of copies will be governed by the requirements of the\n",
      "business. In a small business where the goods are received by the\n",
      "purchasing agent, one copy is sufficient. When a receiving clerk is\n",
      "employed, a second copy will be needed by him to check the receipt of\n",
      "goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "The illustration, Fig. 12, shows a set of six blanks, the original\n",
      "and five copies, which will meet the requirements of the average\n",

      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 12. Typical Form of Manifold Order Blanks]\n",
      "\n",
      "_Original._ This is to be mailed or delivered to the vendor.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Follow-Up Copy._ This copy is retained by the purchasing agent to\n",
      "follow up the order. It is first filed in a tickler, or date file,\n",
      "back of the date when an acknowledgment should be received. If no\n",
      "acknowledgment is received, the vendor is followed up and the order\n",
      "filed ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The order is next filed under the date when the invoice should be\n",
      "received. After the invoice is received, the order copy can be used to\n",
      "follow up the transportation company for delivery.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Receiving Copy._ This copy goes to the receiving clerk who files it\n",
      "according to the name of the vendor. When the goods are received, he\n",
      "checks the items against the copy and returns it to the purchasing\n",
      "agent. In some cases he reports the receipt of goods by means of a\n",
      "receiving slip, which will be explained later.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Auditor's Copy._ In a highly organized business a copy of every order\n",
      "is given to the comptroller or auditor. The principal use of this copy\n",
      "is to furnish information in respect to obligations incurred, that\n",
      "finances may be provided in advance.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Cost Department Copy._ The copy furnished the cost department is to\n",
      "post the cost clerks in prices. In many large factories complete files\n",
      "of all orders placed are kept in the cost office. This is an excellent\n",
      "plan since it provides a complete price record.\n",
      "\n",
      "_Shop Copy._ This is intended for the special use of the factory when\n",
      "located at a distance from the office. It is filed in the office of the\n",
      "factory manager, under the name of the vendor, and supplies him with a\n",
      "record of all orders placed for the factory.\n",
      "\n",
      "=12. Checking Receipts.= The purchasing agent will be advised of the\n",
      "receipt of goods by the return of the receiving clerk's copy of the\n",
      "order, properly checked. Or, in some cases, it may be advisable to have\n",
      "all goods reported on a special form, Fig. 13.\n",

      "is employed, the receiving slip should be made in duplicate. One copy\n",
      "will go to the stores clerk with the goods and will later be sent to\n",
      "the purchasing agent, furnishing a double check on the goods. The\n",
      "purchasing agent will send one copy to the cost clerk, first noting\n",
      "the account to be charged. This gives the cost clerk the necessary\n",
      "information for charging out material when used.\n",
      "\n",
      "One argument in support of this plan is that, having no record of\n",
      "quantities ordered, the receiving clerk will be compelled to carefully\n",
      "count and list all articles received. But it is also true that he is\n",
      "obliged to make a detailed copy instead of merely checking the items\n",
      "against his copy of the order.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another point in connection with the work of the receiving clerk that\n",
      "has caused much discussion, is the wisdom of furnishing him with a\n",
      "record of prices. The prevailing opinion among manufacturers seems\n",
      "to be that this should not be done. This need not interfere with the\n",
      "operation of our system, for prices can be left off the receiving\n",
      "clerk's copy by using a short carbon. This will keep all blanks uniform\n",
      "in size.\n",
      "\n",
      "=13. Checking Invoices.= It may be laid down as a rule that invoices\n",
      "should first go to the purchasing agent, not for audit, but to be\n",
      "checked for quantities and prices. The purchasing agent will check the\n",
      "invoice, note on it the purpose, or the department for which the goods\n",
      "were purchased, and forward it to the auditor. The transaction is then\n",
      "closed so far as the purchasing agent is concerned.\n",
      "\n",
      "=14. Filing.= After the O. K.'d invoice has been forwarded to the\n",
      "auditor, the following papers remaining in the purchasing department\n",
      "are to be filed:\n",
      "\n",
      "_Follow-up copy of the order_, filed alphabetically under the name of\n",
      "the vendor.\n",

      "\n",

      "numerically according to the departmental serial number; that is,\n",
      "all requisitions from _Dept. A_ will be filed together in numerical\n",
      "sequence.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a record of goods received has been made on the forms prescribed,\n",
      "the purchasing agent's records will be complete.\n",
      "\n",

      "THE STORES DEPARTMENT\n",
      "\n",
      "=15.= In this discussion, the _stores department_, or _stock\n",
      "department_ as it is frequently called, is treated as a subordinate\n",
      "division of the purchasing department. Properly organized, it becomes\n",
      "one of the most valuable from a profit-making standpoint. Without\n",
      "organization it may degenerate into one of the most useless.\n",
      "\n",
      "To attain the state of efficiency of which it is capable, the\n",
      "organization and system of operation of the stores department must\n",
      "be of the highest order, otherwise it cannot be expected to fulfill\n",
      "its mission. So much has been written about the failure of stores\n",
      "departments and stores systems to produce desired results, that a\n",
      "statement of what is meant by _stores department_ seems to be demanded\n",
      "before we can arrive at intelligent conclusions regarding its functions\n",
      "and operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Broadly, the stores department is that department of a business which\n",
      "has the custody of its stock in trade, materials, supplies, and\n",
      "other physical property, except real estate. Reduced to a concrete\n",
      "example, in a trading business the term means that department which is\n",
      "responsible for the storage and proper care of the goods purchased for\n",
      "resale; also the materials and appliances required in the operation of\n",
      "the business. There may be no department known by this name; there may\n",
      "be no one man whose duty it is to supervise the work; nevertheless,\n",
      "the department exists. Every clerk in a small retail store may be\n",
      "a receiving clerk, a salesman, and a stores clerk; or in a larger\n",
      "establishment several men may be employed as stockkeepers; but in both\n",
      "cases the responsibilities of the stores department are shouldered by\n",
      "some one, perhaps by several people.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like every other department of a business, the organization of a stores\n",
      "department depends largely upon the nature of the business. To furnish\n",
      "an illustration that can be readily understood, we will treat the\n",
      "organization and operation of the stores department from the standpoint\n",
      "of a manufacturer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ORGANIZATION\n",
      "\n",
      "=16.= The stores department is properly under the direct supervision\n",
      "of the purchasing agent. In the last analysis he is the man who is\n",
      "responsible for the maintenance of a stock of materials and supplies\n",
      "which will at all times be adequate for the business. It is proper,\n",
      "therefore, that he should have supervision over the _receipt_,\n",
      "_storage_, and _delivery_ of the goods which he has purchased.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the actual operation of the stores department, the purchasing agent\n",
      "will delegate his authority to the chief stores clerk, who will in turn\n",
      "be assisted by the necessary number of stock men and a receiving clerk.\n",
      "It will be the duty of the chief stores clerk to see that all materials\n",
      "are properly stored, to maintain the records prescribed, and to furnish\n",
      "such reports as may be necessary regarding the movement of the stock.\n",
      "He will have general supervision over the entire department. In the\n",
      "actual physical operations of the department, he will be assisted by\n",
      "stock men who are subject to his orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "In small establishments the stores clerk also acts as receiving clerk,\n",
      "but in the larger enterprises, a separate receiving clerk is required.\n",
      "He will check the receipt of all goods, deliver them to the storage\n",
      "places prescribed by the chief stores clerk, and make such reports as\n",
      "may be prescribed. While he is, generally speaking, under the orders\n",
      "of the chief stores clerk, he also makes certain reports direct to the\n",
      "purchasing agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "TAKING AN INVENTORY\n",
      "\n",
      "=17.= Before a stores department can be successfully organized an\n",
      "_inventory_ must be taken, for this inventory will be the basis on\n",
      "which the records of the stores department are founded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stores record systems are quite commonly referred to as perpetual\n",
      "inventories, and, occasionally, such a system is pointed to as a\n",
      "failure for the reason that at the end of the year, or other fiscal\n",
      "period, the inventory, that is, the actual physical inventory of the\n",
      "stock, does not check with the records. The fact that systems of stores\n",
      "records have been regarded as inventories _in fact_, is responsible for\n",
      "most so-called failures. Regarded in its proper relation, a perpetual\n",
      "inventory is nothing more nor less than an accurate accounting of all\n",
      "goods that come into and go out of the establishment, these records to\n",
      "be checked by an actual physical inventory with such regularity and\n",
      "frequency that the accounts can safely be considered as exhibiting\n",
      "a correct inventory. In considering the question, how to take an\n",
      "inventory, we refer, therefore, to an actual physical inventory, that\n",
      "is, a count of every article in stock. When once this inventory is\n",
      "taken and properly recorded, it is entirely possible to install and\n",
      "maintain systems which will make it unnecessary to inventory all of\n",
      "the physical property at any one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been the general custom in a large manufacturing establishment\n",
      "to shut down for a period of greater or less duration, running all the\n",
      "way from two or three days to as many weeks, for the purpose of taking\n",
      "an inventory. Since it has been considered necessary to shut down for\n",
      "this purpose, inventories have, as a rule, been taken but once a year.\n",
      "All this is unnecessary, for, with proper methods, it is possible to\n",
      "take even a complete inventory without perceptible interruption of\n",
      "the operation of the plant. The first step is to decide, at just what\n",
      "time the inventory is to be taken, and to have all foremen get their\n",
      "shops in readiness. This means a general cleaning up which will make it\n",
      "easy to locate and count, weigh, or measure the _materials_, _tools_,\n",
      "_supplies_, and _work in process_. Then, at a specified time the work\n",
      "of taking the inventory should be started simultaneously in every shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "The making of the necessary records will be in charge of a clerk who\n",
      "will be assisted by the foremen and as many helpers as may be required.\n",

      "the items on the tag itself. As this is done, the lower half of the\n",
      "tag is torn off. Since a record is kept of the card numbers given to\n",

      "a further precaution against the loss of cards, the remaining part\n",

      "STORES DEPARTMENT A MONEY SAVER\n",
      "\n",
      "=19.= Although a stores department is the first essential in the\n",
      "operation of a cost accounting system, manufacturers sometimes hesitate\n",
      "to install such a department on the ground of expense. Without\n",
      "considering its valuable features, the claim is made that the operation\n",
      "of this department involves a larger expenditure than is warranted by\n",
      "the results. But such claims are not borne out by the experience of\n",
      "manufacturers who have tested the efficiency of the department. Where\n",
      "results are found which appear to support this claim, investigation\n",
      "will invariably reveal faulty installation or faulty operation, or both.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposed to this claim, the experiences of many manufacturers show\n",
      "that the stores department is an actual money saver. If anything like\n",
      "an efficient cost-accounting system is to be maintained, a stores\n",
      "department is an absolute necessity; but even if there is no cost\n",
      "system, a stores department can be made profitable. An adequate system\n",
      "of records in a well-organized stores department will show at all\n",
      "times the exact condition of the stock, and this alone should justify\n",
      "the maintenance of such a department. Slow moving stocks are pointed\n",
      "out, so that a greater effort may be made to move them; if a stock\n",
      "is running low, the records give warning before the danger point is\n",
      "reached. All this applies with the same force to a trading business as\n",
      "to a manufacturing enterprise. By showing the volume of stock on hand,\n",
      "by pointing out its movements, a stores-record system prevents the\n",
      "accumulation of _dead_ stock, yet makes it possible to maintain active\n",
      "stocks at the lowest volume consistent with safety, and thereby saves\n",
      "money by keeping the investment at the lowest possible point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surprising results in money saving through stores-record systems\n",
      "have been shown by some manufacturers. In one case which came within\n",
      "the writer's observation, a reduction of more than $10,000.00 in the\n",
      "average investment was made. A certain manufacturer of machinery, who\n",
      "had an inadequate stores system, found that his stock of material\n",
      "averaged $30,000.00, while the business required a stock of not more\n",
      "than $20,000.00. He engaged a competent man to install and operate\n",
      "the system, paid him a liberal salary, and at the end of a year found\n",
      "that his stock averaged less than $20,000.00. Moreover, the stock\n",
      "was clean--there being nothing in it that was not needed--was well\n",
      "arranged, and in every respect in a more satisfactory condition than\n",
      "before. That meant a saving of the earnings of $10,000.00, and by using\n",
      "it in extending his business, the money was worth 20% to him.\n",
      "\n",

      "INSTALLING A STORES SYSTEM\n",
      "\n",
      "=20.= When the inventory has been completed, the next important step\n",
      "in the organization of a stores department is to provide the necessary\n",
      "_storage_ places for all materials and supplies and see that these are\n",
      "properly stored.\n",
      "\n",
      "The question, as to what is a proper storage place is one which must be\n",
      "worked out to fit conditions as found in the individual establishment.\n",
      "Generally speaking, in a manufacturing business, materials should be\n",
      "located as closely as possible to the departments in which they will\n",
      "be used. In a large plant it is usually necessary to have several\n",
      "storerooms to accommodate the various classes of material, and in\n",
      "order that they may be located conveniently. The question of proper\n",
      "storage is a vitally important one in every business, and especially\n",
      "so in a manufacturing plant. Ideal conditions are impossible to\n",
      "obtain in all plants, but the first consideration should be to have\n",
      "a definite storage place for every class of material, and to always\n",
      "keep the material in that especial place. Go into a plant having no\n",
      "well-defined system of storage, and you will find workmen spending more\n",
      "time looking for materials needed than would have been required to take\n",
      "the same material to a stockroom and withdraw it as needed. In trading\n",
      "businesses the necessity for systematic stock keeping has long been\n",
      "recognized. Wholesale houses have their stock arranged in departments\n",
      "and stored on different floors of the warehouse with special men in\n",
      "charge of stock keeping. A retailer, no matter whether he is operating\n",
      "a department store or dealing exclusively in one class of merchandise,\n",
      "has his goods arranged by departments. But in too many manufacturing\n",
      "plants the question of storage for raw material and supplies has\n",
      "received little consideration. A manufacturer will invest dollars in\n",
      "raw material and keep no record of it; yet the same man would regard\n",
      "as preposterous the suggestion that he should keep no record of cash.\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the material should be as well cared for, and\n",
      "as strictly accounted for, as cash. Every dollar's worth of material\n",
      "should be regarded in the same light as a dollar in gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next in importance to the location of the storerooms is the question\n",
      "of the storage of the material itself. The storerooms should be\n",
      "equipped with such bins, racks, shelves, boxes, and drawers as may be\n",
      "required for the proper care of the material. In storing the material\n",
      "the question of its size and weight, and the frequency with which it\n",
      "will be needed, should be considered. Extremely heavy articles should\n",
      "not be stored on the floor, but should be raised to about the height\n",
      "of a truck, thus saving labor both in unloading and loading. Material\n",
      "which is constantly being called for should be kept on shelves that\n",
      "are within easy reach. The top shelves and inaccessible corners can\n",
      "be reserved for articles seldom called for. As far as possible, all\n",
      "articles of the same class should be kept in the same section of the\n",
      "storeroom. Above all, a given article should always be kept in the same\n",
      "place. In some storerooms it is not uncommon to find, hidden away in\n",
      "some dark corner, articles which are not supposed to be in stock, all\n",
      "because no definite storage place has been provided. The record system\n",
      "can be of little value unless the articles are to be found in the\n",
      "sections allotted to them.\n",
      "\n",
      "All of this but emphasizes the importance of having the storeroom and\n",
      "stores system under the exclusive control of one man. No one should\n",
      "be allowed to interfere with the work of the chief stores clerk. If\n",
      "there is any cause for criticism it should be taken to his superior.\n",
      "Suggestions from foremen and others who are obliged to make use of the\n",
      "storeroom, should, and probably will, be welcomed by the average stores\n",
      "clerk, but no foreman should instruct one of his men to place material\n",
      "in the storeroom except as instructed by its head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from the storeroom proper, the stores clerk will have charge\n",
      "of material stored outside of the plant. Lumber, fuel, and heavy\n",
      "castings are examples of material coming under this head. Nevertheless,\n",
      "his records should include all of this material, and he should have\n",
      "general supervision over its storage in order that he may more readily\n",
      "determine, or more closely estimate, quantities in stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "=21. Receiving.= In the organization of the _stores department_, it\n",
      "is necessary to provide for a record of the _receipt_ of all material\n",
      "and supplies. The system must be so constructed that it will not only\n",
      "insure a record of all goods coming into the establishment, but prevent\n",
      "the acceptance of goods which should not be received.\n",
      "\n",
      "All receiving should, therefore, be in charge of one man. In the larger\n",
      "industrial enterprises, a receiving clerk is employed, whose duty is to\n",
      "receive and receipt for all goods coming into the establishment, and to\n",
      "deliver them to the storeroom or the department in which they are to\n",
      "be used. The stores clerk may, in a small concern, perform all of the\n",
      "functions of the receiving clerk.\n",
      "\n",
      "When goods come in, the receiving clerk will refer to his file of\n",
      "purchase order copies to find if the goods have been ordered. It will\n",
      "be remembered that an alphabetical file has been recommended for these\n",
      "orders, which are to be filed under the name of the shipper. The reason\n",
      "for this is that the package does not always show the nature of its\n",
      "contents, while the name of the shipper is almost invariably shown\n",
      "somewhere on the package or on the shipping tag.\n",
      "\n",
      "Goods should not be accepted by the receiving clerk unless he has an\n",
      "order. To do so is liable to cause trouble. As an illustration, we will\n",
      "suppose that the concern has made a contract for material on which\n",
      "deliveries are to be made at stated intervals. The first shipment\n",
      "received shows that the material is not up to specifications and the\n",
      "contract is cancelled. Pending an adjustment, the receiving clerk is\n",
      "instructed to accept no more material on the contract. If he does so,\n",
      "the concern will very likely be obliged to pay for it, and it may even\n",
      "have a bearing on the entire contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another class of shipments which must be carefully watched is the\n",
      "return of goods by customers of the concern. In some businesses, this\n",
      "question is not important; in others, great care must be exercised to\n",
      "insure proper credit. In a manufacturing or a trading business other\n",
      "than retail, the customer will usually notify the house that he is\n",
      "returning goods. When such a notice is received, instructions should be\n",
      "given to the receiving clerk whether to accept or refuse them.\n",
      "\n",
      "One class of business in which the receipt of returned goods must be\n",
      "handled with extreme care is the installment business. Most installment\n",
      "contracts vest title to the goods in the seller until all payments are\n",
      "made. To avoid payment, a customer may return goods without notice.\n",
      "Acceptance by the seller cancels the contract at once. A safe rule to\n",
      "follow, therefore, is to accept no returned goods until authorized to\n",
      "do so by one in authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The receiving slip, Fig. 13, Page 16, is to be filled out by the\n",
      "receiving clerk. One copy will go to the purchasing agent and the\n",
      "other to the stores clerk. From these reports the stores clerk makes\n",
      "his record of material received. In some cases material ordered for the\n",
      "use of a particular department is to be sent direct to the department\n",
      "and not to the storeroom. A third copy of the report should be made\n",
      "which will be sent to the department, from whence it will go to the\n",
      "stores clerk, properly receipted.\n",
      "\n",
      "=22. Deliveries.= The stores clerk, being in custody of all stock, is\n",
      "responsible not alone for its safe keeping but for deliveries. He must\n",
      "be in a position to show what stock has been delivered, to whom, and\n",
      "for what purpose.\n",

      "forms in the same establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When installing any system, however, it is more economical to invest\n",

      "If certain specific information is required, the form should be\n",
      "designed to exhibit just that information, and if the form is properly\n",

      "The number of forms must not be so large as to cause confusion, but\n",
      "against the opposite extreme the cost of time must be considered. It\n",

      "form will be found satisfactory in most establishments. The form\n",
      "should provide for the name of the material, the unit in which it is\n",
      "purchased, the purpose for which used, the location in the storeroom,\n",

      "for records of this class. In addition to the headings specified\n",
      "above, spaces will be noted at the top of this card for _maximum_ and\n",
      "_minimum_. These refer to the quantities of material to be carried in\n",
      "stock and represent the high and low limits. These limits should be\n",
      "established for each article in stock and when any article reaches the\n",
      "low limit a report should be sent to the purchasing agent on the form\n",

      "=27. Parts and Finished Stores.= A record of parts and finished stores\n",
      "is very essential in many manufacturing enterprises. The modern\n",
      "tendency in machinery manufacture, for instance, is to standardize\n",
      "production, making all parts interchangeable. Parts are manufactured in\n",

      "It is very necessary to know the condition of the stock of parts to\n",
      "insure against overstocking, and to prevent the supply running low. A\n",
      "record of parts should therefore be maintained on the same lines as\n",
      "for material and supplies. Usually, a parts storeroom, with a clerk in\n",

      "=28. Material Returned to Stock.= When a foreman receives an order\n",
      "to manufacture a certain article, or part, he estimates the quantity\n",
      "of material required and draws it from the storeroom. Naturally he\n",

      "for such a report is shown in Fig. 32. An essential feature of this\n",

      "and forward the report to the cost department. The cost and value will\n",
      "then be entered and credited on the cost records.\n",
      "\n",
      "=29. Material Transferred.= When a foreman has left-over material which\n",
      "can be used on another job, a report is necessary to insure credit to\n",
      "the job for which it was drawn and a charge to the job on which it\n",
      "was used. Fig. 33 is a form for this report. This shows the numbers of\n",
      "the jobs for which the material was drawn and to which the material\n",
      "has been transferred. After entering the correct quantities on his\n",
      "stores record, he sends the report to the cost department. If it is not\n",

      "Not infrequently a new part will be needed for a machine which has been\n",

      "repairs and additions, and the amount charged off for depreciation.\n",
      "Such a record should be kept, but no special form is required. The\n",
      "machine inventory form, Fig. 15, answers the purpose. For the more\n",

      "=2.= Wage systems, as applied to manufacturing industries, may be\n",
      "divided into the general classifications of day wage, piece rate, and\n",

      "\n",
      "=3. Day Wage.= Of the three general plans on which labor is paid, the\n",
      "oldest and best known is the day-wage plan. It is the most widely used\n",
      "because best understood. The day-wage plan contemplates the payment of\n",
      "a stated wage for a stated unit of time. If all men performing the same\n",
      "task were equally skillful, or if the wage rate could be adjusted in\n",
      "conformity with the varying degrees of productiveness found in every\n",
      "body of workmen, the day-wage plan would be ideal. But neither of these\n",
      "conditions exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers are liable to insist on the application of the rule of\n",
      "organized labor, that all men performing similar tasks shall be paid\n",
      "the same wage. Since all men are not equally skillful, this results\n",
      "in certain inequalities. On the one hand, the wage rate is based on\n",
      "the lowest rate of production, which is unjust to the more skillful\n",
      "man, who either reduces his productiveness to the level of the least\n",
      "skillful, or transfers his energies to another field of endeavor. As an\n",
      "opposite extreme, the rate is based on the highest rate of production,\n",
      "which is manifestly unfair to the employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In actual practice, then, it is necessary, from the standpoint of the\n",
      "employer, to employ overseers to drive all workmen to a maximum rate of\n",
      "production, which, theoretically, means the elimination of all workers\n",
      "who are unable to attain the maximum. Again an injustice results, this\n",
      "time to the weaker man.\n",
      "\n",
      "=4. Piece Rate.= The first plan evolved, in the search for a plan that\n",
      "would remedy the inequalities of the day-wage plan, was the piece-rate\n",
      "plan. The piece-rate plan contemplates the payment of a stated wage per\n",
      "unit of production, without consideration of the rate of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "The argument was advanced that a uniform rate per unit of production\n",
      "would result in an equitable wage, because based on the productive\n",
      "skill of the individual. But the plan has failed in many cases to\n",
      "produce the desired results, for the reason that it does not take into\n",
      "consideration the factor of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the establishment of a wage rate, the factor of time must be\n",
      "considered, or the rate will not be equitable as between employer and\n",
      "employe. The employer must furnish the shop, the tools, the power,\n",
      "the heat and light. The cost of these items does not necessarily vary\n",
      "in direct ratio with the increase or decrease in production. These\n",
      "expenses must be absorbed by the finished product, therefore, even\n",
      "under a piece-rate plan, the rate of production (the factor of time)\n",
      "has an actual bearing on the rate per unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the standpoint of the employer, the rate per unit should be based\n",
      "on the productiveness of the individual, and should insure to the\n",
      "most skillful, a wage as high as, or slightly higher than, he would\n",
      "receive under the day-wage plan. This would, in theory, give to the\n",
      "less skillful man a wage exactly commensurate with his skill. But as\n",
      "workers become more and more skillful, and increase at the same time\n",
      "their productiveness and their earning capacity above normal, there is\n",
      "a tendency on the part of the employer to reduce the rate per unit to\n",
      "bring the aggregate wage back to normal. The result is that the worker,\n",
      "fearing a reduction in the rate, limits his production to the number of\n",
      "units that will insure an average wage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the system fails in its object. It does not reduce the cost\n",
      "of production to the lowest point. However, when piece rates are\n",
      "intelligently applied they are found very satisfactory in certain\n",
      "lines. But in all cases, the piece rate tends toward a uniform rate of\n",
      "production, and, while reducing the cost of superintendence, involves\n",
      "the expense of inspection. The latter, however, is not necessarily an\n",
      "added expense, for, as a rule, inspection is required regardless of the\n",
      "wage system in use.\n",
      "\n",
      "=5. Premium Systems.= To obviate the difficulties found in both the\n",
      "day-wage and piece-rate plans, the _premium_ or _bonus_ system was\n",
      "evolved. This improved system of wages is intended to fulfill the\n",
      "following conditions:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. A guaranteed rate per hour for each grade of work for a contract\n",
      " period.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. An average earning power continuously higher than usual.\n",

      " increase.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. A supplemental earning power, or bonus, to the worker above the day\n",
      " wage, the bonus being based on efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "The premium system is a combination of day wage and piece rate,\n",
      "involving the establishment of standard times for stated tasks. It\n",
      "is based on the theory that if, when a standard time has been fairly\n",
      "established, the worker performs a task in less than standard time, he\n",
      "is entitled to a bonus, or extra pay, for the time saved. The bonus is\n",
      "based on the wage rate paid for standard time.\n",
      "\n",
      "For what part of the time saved the workman should be paid, depends\n",
      "on circumstances. It might be argued that the workman is entitled\n",
      "to full pay for all of the time saved, but other factors than the\n",
      "dexterity of the workman enter into the time saving. The employer\n",
      "supplies additional power, there is an extra cost for wear and tear on\n",
      "machinery, and an extra quality of material; all have a bearing on time\n",
      "saving. The employer is, therefore, entitled to a part of the saving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The original premium system is known as the _Halsey_ plan. There are,\n",
      "however, several well-known modifications of the plan, all based on\n",
      "efficiency, but each having certain distinguishing characteristics. No\n",
      "more clear presentation of the essential features of the best known\n",
      "premium systems has been made, than is found in a review by Mr. Carl\n",
      "Bender, published in the Engineering Magazine, from which the following\n",
      "is quoted:\n",
      "\n",
      " HALSEY PREMIUM PLAN\n",
      "\n",
      " To mitigate to some extent the evil workings of piece rates, Mr. F.\n",
      " Halsey invented the premium plan shown in Fig. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      " The slant of the wage line may be at any angle from horizontal,\n",
      " straight piece rate, to coalescence with day rate line. This system\n",
      " possesses at least four valuable points:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. It pays day rates if a longer time is taken than standard.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. It is a very flexible system and can be adapted to different\n",
      " conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. It lessens but does not obviate the necessity of changing rates.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. It lessens but does not wholly remove the inclination to limit\n",
      " output.\n",
      "\n",
      " It is in one respect a step backward, since it substitutes uncertainty\n",
      " for definiteness as to wage costs. Nevertheless, the Halsey system\n",
      " was an admirable step in advance. Usually the worker is given either\n",
      " one-half or one-third the time he saves. Psychologically it is much\n",
      " better than piece rate, since most workers are more inclined to lessen\n",
      " their time than to increase the number of pieces turned out. A man\n",
      " will deliberately decide that he ought not to turn out more than five\n",
      " pieces a day, but he will not feel the same desire to avoid breaking\n",
      " his own record of two hours per piece.\n",
      "\n",
      " Under the Halsey system, no limit is placed on a man's earning power\n",
      " per hour, and also a minimum piece rate of one-half or one-third the\n",
      " initial rate per piece is allowed, so that if a man worked on his\n",
      " own time, he would at least receive per piece one-half or one-third\n",

      " TAYLOR SYSTEM\n",
      "\n",
      " A fundamental departure was made by Mr. Fred W. Taylor, in his\n",
      " differential piece-rate system, a diagram of which is shown in Fig. 2.\n",
      " Mr. Taylor does not establish an initial time by guess or by assuming\n",
      " a more rapid gait than on day work, nor does he appropriate other\n",
      " unscientifically determined times. His method is to standardize all\n",
      " conditions in the shop, to make them as perfect and smoothly acting\n",
      " as circumstances will permit, and then to determine a reasonable\n",
      " minimum time in which the job can be done. As a result, Taylor's\n",
      " standard times are very much lower and also very much more carefully\n",
      " and accurately determined than any system hitherto considered. Mr.\n",
      " Taylor scorns the suggestion that by any chance the worker could earn\n",
      " excessive wages. Any wages that an unusually efficient worker can\n",
      " earn are legitimately his own. Assuming that under the Taylor system\n",
      " a worker should do four pieces in four hours, his wages for the time\n",
      " would be $1.00, but Mr. Taylor allows an increase of 20 per cent, 25\n",
      " per cent, 30 per cent, or even more, according to the class of work,\n",
      " for ascertaining standard time. Let us assume 20 per cent increase.\n",
      " The worker then receives for four pieces in four hours, $1.20, a rate\n",
      " of $0.30 each. For less than four pieces the maximum hourly rate is\n",
      " $0.25, therefore $0.25 each. If the worker only delivers three pieces\n",
      " in four hours, his earnings are only $0.75, or $0.1875 per hour. Mr.\n",
      " Taylor's system awards, therefore, a heavy and increasing premium for\n",
      " high efficiency, a heavy penalty for low efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      " The method of standard time determination is so rigorous that the\n",
      " worker cannot figure on curtailing his output. He has to hustle to\n",
      " make wages even at the low piece rate, and if he succeeds in this, a\n",
      " very little extra effort will give him a higher piece rate.\n",
      "\n",
      " The excellence of the system lies in the accuracy with which proper\n",
      " rates are predetermined. It is, however, somewhat inflexible and not\n",
      " so well adapted to work in which unforeseeable variations in time\n",
      " occur.\n",

      "As in Mr. Taylor's system, the proper time is most carefully and\n",
      "accurately predetermined. If the worker reaches the proper time, he is\n",
      "given a bonus of 25 per cent above normal wages for the time. If he\n",
      "does still better, he is given half of what he makes, as in the Halsey\n",
      "plan. If he does not reach standard time, he is paid only 75 per cent\n",
      "of normal wages for the excessive time, provided bonus earned permits\n",
      "the imposition of this fine. If he had bonus to his credit he would not\n",
      "be fined, however much he fell below standard.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system has shown certain psychological disadvantages in practice:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The men have made it a point of semi-honor, among themselves, not to\n",
      "do better than standard times.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Although the actual fines for failing to reach standard times were\n",
      "insignificant, the men claimed that they were being robbed of thousands\n",
      "of dollars in this manner. Neither fall-downs nor ability to lessen\n",
      "standard time are always up to the man. It is therefore unfortunate\n",
      "when a favorable chance occurs to lessen time, that the worker\n",
      "deliberately holds back. It is also often unjust that he should be\n",
      "fined for what may not be his fault.\n",

      " It pays a high premium above wage or piece rate for coöperation or\n",

      " whether they be too low or too high, and it makes this revision\n",

      "    10 hours. The average shop or department efficiency factor equalizes\n",
      "    accidental variations.\n",
      "\n",
      "(3) It separates absolutely all questions of wage rate from questions\n",
      "    of output, shop conditions, or individual excellence.\n",
      "\n",
      "(4) It fines the management heavily if shop conditions are not\n",
      "    maintained so as to realize standard times.\n",
      "\n",
      "(5) It puts no limit on the ambition or earning power of any man.\n",
      "\n",
      "(6) Standard times are being constantly corrected. If the standard man\n",
      "    cannot average 100 per cent on his schedules, it is evident that some\n",
      "    of them are too short and ought to be lengthened. If on the other hand,\n",
      "    a new machine tool is introduced, new schedules are drawn up for it,\n",
      "    but the worker will not, on that account, make less than he did on the\n",
      "    old schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is too much to expect that any system of paying wages will\n",
      "prevent an outbreak of selfish interests whether of employer or wage\n",
      "earner. There will, however, be a distinct gain if the nature of the\n",
      "disagreement can be made entirely distinct and plain. Clear thinking\n",

      "systems may contribute towards clearer conceptions and more just\n",
      "practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "To establish a modern wage system, standard times must be determined\n",
      "on a scientific basis, and the rate must not only be equitable as\n",
      "between employer and employe, but, as Mr. Bender has said, \"it must\n",
      "hit the men right.\" Shop conditions must be right and every facility\n",
      "given the workmen to attain standard time or better, including teaching\n",
      "him how to do the work in standard time. The _speeder_ or _task\n",

      "basing standard times on his operations, first determines as closely\n",
      "as possible what the time should be, and then teaches his men how to\n",
      "attain that time. Where stop-watch methods foster discontent and breed\n",
      "antagonism, instruction is followed by coöperation. The average man\n",
      "does not object to doing a task in a stated time when he is given the\n",
      "facilities for doing the work that will make that a reasonable time.\n",

      "METHODS OF TIME KEEPING\n",
      "\n",
      "=6.= Time keeping may be divided into two classes. The first class\n",
      "includes methods of recording the total time that the employe works\n",
      "during a pay-roll period. The second class includes methods of\n",
      "recording the results of the labor of each employe--the quantity\n",
      "produced, expressed in the units adopted by the trade in which he is\n",
      "employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: BATTERY OF HYDRAULIC PRESSES (3000 AND 4000 TONS\n",
      "CAPACITY) IN HEAVY FORGING SHOP OF THE J. G. BRILL COMPANY,\n",
      "PHILADELPHIA, PENNA.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordinarily, trading concerns require records of the first class only,\n",
      "the pay of the employe being based on the time spent, rather than on\n",
      "the quantity of his production. This is because of established custom\n",
      "and the difficulty of measuring his production. Primarily, the pay of\n",
      "the employe is based on his efficiency, but it is not always practical\n",
      "to attempt to reduce the results of that efficiency to standard units.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturers require records of both classes. Not only is it necessary\n",
      "to know how many hours each employe has worked, but the quantity of\n",
      "production must be known.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is true that a manufacturing business requires the services of some\n",
      "employes whose productiveness is not readily expressed in standard\n",
      "units, in which cases the first method only can be used. These are\n",
      "the men who are necessary to the economical operation of a department\n",
      "or shop, or of the plant as a whole, but whose time cannot be charged\n",
      "to a particular job. Labor of this class is termed _indirect_ or\n",
      "_non-productive_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The labor of most employes in a manufacturing plant is applied directly\n",
      "to the production of specific articles, or to the completion of certain\n",
      "definite jobs. This makes it possible to reduce the results of their\n",
      "labor to definite units. Labor of this class is termed _direct_ or\n",
      "_productive_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Records of production, as well as records of time, are necessary for\n",
      "two reasons. First, when the piece rate or the more modern premium\n",
      "system is used, employes are paid according to the number of units\n",
      "produced. Second, to obtain accurate records of costs, it is necessary\n",
      "to have accurate records of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the purpose of determining the amount of wages due the piece\n",
      "worker, time records are not needed; records of production supply the\n",
      "information required. But to determine the actual labor cost per unit,\n",
      "time records are needed even in the case of piece workers. Piece rates\n",
      "are based on continuous production at a uniform rate. A marked falling\n",
      "off in production means a perceptible increase in the cost per unit for\n",
      "overhead expense. For example, we will suppose that a manufacturer has\n",
      "$50,000.00 invested in machines operated by piece workers. One of the\n",
      "definite items of expense to be apportioned to the product of these\n",
      "machines is interest, at say five or six per cent. If production falls\n",
      "to one-half of the normal quantity, because one-half of the machines\n",
      "are idle, the amount of this one item of expense that must be borne\n",
      "by each unit of production is doubled. Or, we may have two workers\n",
      "operating identical machines on the same class of work, the production\n",
      "of one being twice that of the other. The overhead expense is the\n",
      "same for each employe and each machine, consequently the cost of the\n",
      "finished product is affected by the factor of time. The piece worker\n",
      "who fails to maintain the rate of production established as standard in\n",
      "his or her trade, is not a profitable worker.\n",
      "\n",
      "=7. Time-Keeping Systems.= There are several systems or methods of\n",
      "time keeping in use. No one system is adapted for use under all\n",
      "conditions. Like all other classes of records, the time-keeping system\n",
      "must be selected with reference to the conditions under which it is to\n",
      "be operated. The system used in a factory, where all operatives are\n",
      "housed in one or more buildings, is not well adapted to the needs of a\n",
      "contractor whose men may be working on jobs located at points widely\n",
      "separated.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this discussion, we will consider first the systems used to record\n",
      "the total time employed. This will be followed with descriptions of\n",
      "systems for obtaining records of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "=8. Time Book and Check Systems.= Of the time-keeping systems that have\n",
      "been at some time considered standard, the oldest is the time book kept\n",
      "by the time-keeper. This system required the time-keeper to identify\n",
      "each man at work, and to record, opposite his name in the time book,\n",
      "the number of hours worked each day. Sometimes a special time-keeper\n",
      "was employed, or the foreman might keep the time book for his own men,\n",
      "the time books of all foremen being turned in for the purpose of making\n",
      "up the pay-roll. A system so dependent on the memory of one man never\n",
      "could become satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the object in view of doing away with the mistakes that were\n",
      "continually being made in the operation of the time-book system, the\n",
      "check system was introduced. This was probably the first attempt at\n",
      "automatic time recording.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the check system, each man is assigned a number and given a\n",
      "brass check on which his number is stamped. In entering the works the\n",
      "men are required to pass in front of the time-keeper's office and to\n",
      "hand in their checks. The time-keeper has, in his office, a large board\n",
      "with hooks numbered to correspond with the check numbers. As the checks\n",
      "are handed in they are hung in their proper places on this board. The\n",
      "checks on the board show what men are in the works, and from them the\n",
      "necessary entries are made in the time books.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the men pass out at noon their checks are handed to them. Every\n",
      "man must pass out and take his check; otherwise he will not receive\n",
      "credit for the half-day's time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system does not prove entirely satisfactory for several reasons.\n",
      "It is not exact, for no accurate record of the time a man enters is\n",
      "possible. Usually the time-keeper's window is closed at starting time\n",
      "and opened fifteen minutes later to take care of the late arrivals.\n",
      "Thus the man who is one minute late pays the same penalty in lost time\n",
      "as the man who comes in fifteen minutes after the whistle blows. As a\n",
      "natural result, when a man finds that he cannot reach the works on time\n",
      "he takes the full fifteen minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the handing in of a check furnishes reasonable proof that the man\n",
      "has entered the works, it furnishes no proof that he is at his work.\n",
      "Many a man has turned in his check in the morning, left the works by\n",
      "another exit, returned a few minutes before noon, received his check\n",
      "and full pay for the half day.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some manufacturing plants where the check system is still used, this\n",
      "difficulty has been overcome to a certain extent. The operation of the\n",
      "system is reversed, the men receiving their checks from the time-keeper\n",
      "as they enter the works. In the shops there are check boards on which\n",
      "the men hang their checks. These boards are hinged and provided with\n",
      "locks, the keys being carried by the foremen. Five minutes after\n",
      "starting time the boards are locked, and late arrivals are required to\n",
      "turn in their checks to the foreman who makes records of the time of\n",
      "arrival. Once during each working period, the time-keeper makes the\n",
      "rounds of the shops and takes the time records in his time book. At the\n",
      "quitting hour the boards are unlocked, the men take their checks as\n",
      "they pass out, and turn them in at the time-keeper's office.\n",
      "\n",
      "=9. Time Clocks.= The modern system of time recording makes use of a\n",
      "time clock or mechanical recorder. Instead of trusting to the accuracy\n",
      "of a time-keeper, or depending on the workmen to keep records of their\n",
      "own time, the modern recorder automatically records the time of arrival\n",
      "and departure of every employe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mechanical time recorders, or time clocks, are of two general types,\n",
      "making two classes of records. One type records the time of one employe\n",
      "on a single card or sheet; the other makes a record of the time of\n",
      "several employes on the same sheet. For recording the total time of\n",
      "employes, both types are used, and certain advantages are claimed for\n",
      "each.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 5. Rochester Time Recorder, Manufactured by\n",

      "\n",
      "The records of the first type, most generally used, have a card for\n",
      "each employe on which a record is made of his time for an entire week\n",
      "or pay period. In operation, this system is very simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "At each side of the clock is a card rack, as shown in Fig. 5. One of\n",
      "these is an \"out\" rack, the other an \"in\" rack. At the beginning of\n",
      "each week or pay period, cards are placed in the numbered pockets of\n",
      "the out rack, which is nearest the entrance--one card for each man.\n",
      "These cards bear the numbers or names of the men, or both if desired.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the employe enters, he takes his card from the out rack, places it\n",
      "in the slot of the clock, makes an exact record of the time of arrival\n",
      "by moving a lever, and places the card in the proper numbered pocket\n",
      "in the in rack. When he leaves, the operation is repeated, this time\n",
      "the card being deposited in the out rack. In the meantime the recording\n",
      "device in the clock has been shifted so that it records the leaving\n",
      "time in the proper column on the card.\n",
      "\n",
      "The form of record made by one of the best known clocks of this type is\n",
      "shown in Fig. 6. It will be noted that the recording device prints the\n",
      "letter representing the day of the week in front of each record--out\n",
      "or in. Another feature is the dash under the afternoon registrations;\n",
      "a glance shows whether the registration was made at, for instance, 6\n",

      "the time for the week. In the outside column, at the right, is entered\n",
      "the time lost or the overtime for each day. At the end of the week,\n",
      "the net total of this column is added to or subtracted from the total\n",
      "hours representing a full week, which gives the total number of hours\n",
      "actually worked.\n",

      "A recorder of this type is illustrated by Fig. 7. To register the time\n",

      "against the efficiency of the department, and the aggregate of all such\n",

      "conditions--when the department, shop, or plant is running full time\n",
      "at full capacity; when all of the time of every employe is accounted\n",
      "for by his job time cards; when there is no wasted time or unusual\n",

      "be--this should be the goal, to reach which, managers, engineers,\n",

      "before the ideal is reached, the inefficiency burden should be added as\n",
      "a separate item after all other items of cost have been computed.\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example of the effect of the application of this principle\n",
      "of considering efficiency in figuring costs, we will consider an\n",
      "imaginary case. We will suppose that, in a certain month, the\n",
      "pay-roll for direct or productive labor in our shop is $4,000; that\n",
      "40 completed machines--identical in every respect--are produced; that\n",
      "every minute of the time of every productive employe is accounted\n",

      "machine. During the next month the same men are employed at the same\n",
      "cost--$4,000--but owing to an unusual breakdown, 2 1/2% of the time of\n",
      "these men is wasted; they are idle while the breakdown is repaired, and\n",
      "but 39 machines are produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the $4,000 wages paid is charged as direct or productive labor it\n",
      "gives a cost of $102.56 each--an increase in cost with nothing in the\n",
      "figures that shows the cause. If, however, an inefficiency charge of\n",
      "$100 (2 1/2% of $4,000) or $2.56 per machine is added as a separate\n",
      "item, it is seen at once that here is an unusual item of expense. The\n",
      "amount ($2.56 per machine) is included in the final costs, but in the\n",
      "right place; there is no cause for confusion on account of an apparent,\n",
      "but not real, increase in the productive labor cost. If the cost of\n",
      "$100 per machine obtained during the preceding month is standard\n",
      "for productive labor, it still is the attainable standard; the fact\n",
      "of an unusual expense has in no way affected the legitimate cost of\n",

      "Another great advantage in presenting the labor cost statistics in this\n",

      "MANUFACTURING ORDERS\n",
      "\n",
      "=22.= One of the principles that must be kept in mind when installing a\n",
      "system of any description is that provision must be made for recording\n",
      "every detail of the work intended to be cared for by the system. While\n",
      "this holds true in respect to the systems in every other department of\n",
      "a business, it is of special importance in the manufacturing branch.\n",
      "Accurate costs are out of the question unless every detail of the\n",
      "operations of the plant is properly recorded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Experience has shown but one method that will insure accurate\n",
      "records, and that method is to manufacture all goods on definite\n",
      "orders and to charge all work not applied to a specific manufacturing\n",
      "order, to expense or operating accounts. The receipt of an order to\n",
      "manufacture before starting the work, is of the same importance to the\n",
      "superintendent as that the commercial department shall receive an order\n",
      "from the customer before shipping goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Few managers will accept verbal orders for the manufacture of expensive\n",
      "goods, without asking for a confirmation in writing. When those\n",
      "orders are transmitted to the manufacturing department, it is just as\n",
      "important that they shall be in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manufacturing orders are of two classes: general orders to the\n",
      "superintendent to manufacture a certain quantity of goods, and specific\n",
      "orders to shop foremen to do some part of the work. For convenience,\n",
      "these orders will be referred to in this discussion as _Production_\n",
      "orders and _Shop_ orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "=23. Production Orders.= The production order is the written\n",
      "instructions to the superintendent to manufacture certain goods. It\n",
      "is his authority to secure the necessary material, to employ the\n",
      "required number of men, and to convert that material and labor into the\n",
      "finished product. The production order may call for the manufacture of\n",
      "the quantity of goods of a certain type required to fill one or more\n",
      "customers' orders; the manufacture of a certain quantity of goods to be\n",
      "placed in stock, from which to fill future orders; the conversion of a\n",
      "definite quantity of raw material into finished products; or even the\n",
      "manufacture of an indefinite quantity of raw material into an equally\n",
      "indefinite quantity of the finished product, but within a definite\n",
      "period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Usually the production orders of one factory will be confined to\n",
      "one class, though there are some exceptions. In the first class, we\n",
      "find shops manufacturing special machinery, jobbing foundries, and\n",
      "mills manufacturing underwear and hosiery. In the latter business the\n",
      "goods are sold in advance, from samples, and only the quantities or\n",
      "particular styles required to fill orders are manufactured.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second class includes furniture factories, typewriter factories,\n",
      "the manufacture of tools, and numberless similar industries in which a\n",
      "stock of standard goods is manufactured for future sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "An example of the third class is found in a harness factory. In this\n",
      "business, a certain number of sides of leather are issued to the\n",
      "cutting room to be cut. Since the leather is not uniform in weight\n",
      "or texture, it is not possible to cut an entire side of leather into\n",
      "pieces of the same size, or the same parts of a harness--as lines or\n",
      "traces. The cutter must use his best judgment, so cutting the leather\n",
      "that it will produce the largest possible volume of usable stock, with\n",

      "=2. True Cost--What Is It?= Without trespassing on the general subject\n",
      "of cost accounts, it is quite essential to clearly establish at the\n",
      "very outset what constitutes _true cost_. It would be difficult to\n",
      "conceive of a manufacturer to-day who would simply take the value of\n",
      "wages paid and material used for a cost price, and to this amount add\n",
      "the usual percentage of profit he desires to make on his output, and\n",
      "sell at that price. It would be folly to attempt business on any such\n",
      "basis. No business can be conducted without expense, and yet, in the\n",
      "case just cited, the manufacturer has simply ignored it. Suppose the\n",
      "expense of conducting his business exceeds the percentage he added\n",
      "for profit, what then? He soon finds he has made a serious error in\n",
      "figuring his cost, and the item omitted is the cause of his business\n",
      "losses. His selling price was based on less than the true cost of his\n",
      "product and it is noted he has made no provision, in making up his cost\n",
      "price, for covering the expense of operating his factory, his offices,\n",
      "and general expense, including insurance and taxes. It is apparent\n",
      "then that this matter of _expense_ has a very important bearing on the\n",
      "cost, in fact is a part of it, and must be carefully considered in\n",
      "making up the cost records. The factor of expense is frequently found\n",
      "to be greater than the direct labor cost itself, and a successful\n",
      "manufacturer must know how much expense his costs should absorb and how\n",
      "to figure it. The sales from his product must more than pay for the\n",
      "direct cost to manufacture and all the expenses of his factory besides,\n",
      "and if his sales are not sufficient to pay for both there is no profit.\n",
      "This expense, then, is an indirect charge to the cost of production,\n",
      "and must be included in it before the selling price can be established.\n",
      "Many a manufacturer has been ruined by not properly handling his\n",
      "manufacturing expense, and the necessity for its careful consideration\n",
      "cannot be emphasized too strongly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Clinton E. Woods, one of our leading authorities in factory\n",

      "=3. Selling Expense.= _Selling expense_, oftentimes spoken of as\n",
      "_commercial expense_, has no bearing on cost price. The correctness\n",
      "of this position is easily shown. Two manufacturers, competitors in\n",
      "the same line of production, both operating up-to-date plants with the\n",
      "finest equipment, may produce at the same cost. The expense necessary\n",
      "to market the product from one factory may be so excessive as to cause\n",
      "one concern to lose business to their competitors who can sell their\n",
      "output at less expense, while the actual cost to manufacture may be\n",
      "identical in both shops. Again, while one manufacturer, who can produce\n",
      "at a low cost but carries a heavy selling expense, may conduct his\n",
      "business at a loss, his next door rival in trade may not be able to\n",
      "manufacture as economically but can sell his product with less expense,\n",
      "and thereby carry on a profitable business. In the two instances cited,\n",
      "the key to the losses of one manufacturer and to the profits of the\n",
      "other is in the expense of selling, and not in the cost of production.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a large plant with an elaborate, well-organized, and expensive\n",
      "sales division, where the dividing line between the commercial and\n",
      "production expense is clear cut, these two expense accounts should be\n",
      "kept entirely separate; the commercial being charged off to _Loss_\n",
      "and _Gain_ direct, while the latter only should be merged into\n",
      "manufacturing cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a small plant, where the selling division is conducted through the\n",
      "general office at an expense so small as not to affect the cost of\n",
      "administration over what would be necessary for manufacturing purposes\n",
      "only, or where there is difficulty in separating the selling from the\n",
      "manufacturing expense, the two are often combined as general expense\n",
      "and pro-rated as one account into production costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theoretically, selling expense is not a charge to production, but the\n",
      "dividing line between this view and the practical one in most cases\n",
      "is a very fine one, and in the interest of simplification instead of\n",
      "elaboration, the commercial will be treated in this presentation of the\n",
      "subject as a part of the general expense, and will be considered in\n",
      "detail later.\n",
      "\n",
      "=4. Expense Based on Cost Price or Selling Price.= Having shown that\n",
      "expense is of necessity an item which must enter into true cost, the\n",
      "question at once arises as to what it is related. Is the amount of\n",
      "expense to be borne by any article of production based on its cost or\n",
      "its selling price? While it is noted that some accountants claim the\n",
      "latter should be the basis for calculation, the consensus of opinion\n",
      "seems decidedly in favor of the cost price as the correct one, and\n",
      "there seems to be good argument for the stand thus taken:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) Inasmuch as the selling price cannot be established until the\n",
      "cost price has been ascertained, which is to include the expense, it\n",
      "is apparent that the expense must be calculated from data already in\n",
      "hand; either the direct labor or material cost. The selling price is\n",
      "established after, and contingent on, the cost price, not the reverse.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) Again, the selling price may vary according to the demands of\n",
      "trade; different prices to different classes of customers, as well as\n",
      "the wholesale and retail prices for the same article. In either case,\n",
      "the cost price is the same and is not influenced one way or the other\n",
      "by the selling price. The selling price may fluctuate while the cost\n",
      "price remains positive and stationary.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) While the selling price is theoretically based on cost, it is often\n",
      "fixed by the trade, or regulated to meet competition regardless of\n",
      "cost, and the expense accounts are found to continue about the same\n",
      "each month whether the selling price is high or low.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) In times of depression, or when business is slack, it is common\n",
      "practice to \"mark down\" the selling price and increase the amount of\n",
      "sales at a smaller percentage of profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "(e) It is difficult to see wherein there would be any difference in the\n",
      "expense of manufacturing an article which sells at $110.00 over what it\n",
      "would be were the price but $100.00, yet there would be if the selling\n",
      "price were used as a basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other reasons will suggest themselves, but these just referred to are\n",
      "quite sufficient to show that the selling price is too erratic and that\n",
      "expense will be found more reliable when figured at cost price, which\n",
      "method has, therefore, been adopted as the best practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "=5. Expense Based on Cost of Labor or Material.= Having decided that\n",
      "expense should be reduced in some manner from the direct cost price\n",
      "rather than the selling price, it is remembered that we still have two\n",
      "items of cost to choose from: The labor cost and that of the material.\n",
      "There are those who maintain that the material cost is the correct\n",
      "starting point for calculations, but there are few manufacturers, if\n",
      "any, who do this.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attempt has been made to use the combined total of labor cost and\n",
      "material, but this method is hardly worthy of serious consideration.\n",
      "The best practice points almost without argument to the labor cost as\n",
      "the true basis of expense; this is not only the logical conclusion but\n",
      "common sense:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) It is easy to see that the elements which go to make up the expense\n",
      "of operating a factory--foremen, sub-foremen, supervision, shop clerks,\n",
      "toolkeepers and grinders, helpers, the up-keep of tools and machines,\n",
      "lighting, etc.--are all closely related and largely dependent upon\n",
      "the number of men employed. Reduce the number employed and it will be\n",
      "seen at once that some of the above mentioned items of expense can\n",
      "be cut; less supervision is required and the wear and tear on tools\n",
      "and machinery is also reduced. It is difficult to see wherein any\n",
      "difference in cost of the material used would of itself cause any\n",
      "increase or decrease in the factory expense or even be influenced by\n",
      "it. It is quite contingent on the labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) That the cost of the material is not a reliable basis for\n",
      "calculating expense can be quite satisfactorily demonstrated. If the\n",
      "cost of an article is, say, labor $25.00, material $50.00, with expense\n",
      "to be figured at 50% on material, or $25.00, it is seen at once that\n",
      "the manufacturing cost would be:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Labor             $25.00\n",
      "  Material           50.00\n",

      "\n",
      "Suppose this article were duplicated under the same identical\n",
      "conditions and cost, using only this time material that cost $60.00.\n",
      "It is a fair proposition that the total cost would be but $10.00 more\n",
      "than in the first instance, or $110.00. But if the percentage is added\n",
      "on the material as before, it is found that the expense this time is\n",
      "$30.00, which would make the cost appear thus:\n",
      "\n",
      "  Labor             $25.00\n",
      "  Material           60.00\n",

      "It is now noted that the cost figures $15.00 more than in the first\n",
      "instance, while we are quite ready to admit it should be but $10.00,\n",
      "the only difference being in the cost of the material.\n",
      "\n",
      "=6. Conclusions.= Having established the fact that the expense is a\n",
      "legitimate charge to the cost of production, we are now quite safe\n",
      "in laying down for our foundation the proposition that expense is\n",
      "contingent on, and should be figured from, the direct labor value of\n",

      "METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION\n",
      "\n",
      "=7.= Time is continually bringing improvements; old methods once\n",
      "thought practical and satisfactory are replaced by more efficient\n",
      "ones to meet the exacting conditions of to-day. Examine a _Practical\n",
      "Bookkeeping-Manufacturer's Edition_ of thirty or forty years ago\n",
      "and you will probably find nothing on this subject of _expense\n",
      "distribution_, while to-day it is one of the most important and most\n",
      "discussed of any in factory accounting in general, and cost accounting\n",
      "in particular. Since that time different methods of handling expense\n",
      "have been devised, some with more or less merit. It will be the intent\n",
      "of this section to consider at some length three of the most frequently\n",
      "used of these methods, endeavoring to find one which will, in the most\n",
      "equitable manner, distribute into production the operating expense of a\n",
      "factory with the least amount of detail and unnecessary figuring on the\n",
      "part of the accountant; and at the same time prove satisfactory from\n",
      "the manufacturer's standpoint.\n",
      "\n",
      "=8. The Man-Hour Rate Method.= This method, once quite popular, is now\n",
      "but little used, and it is doubtful if it can be found in operation\n",
      "in many up-to-date plants at the present time. The name of the method\n",
      "suggests its intent, which was to distribute factory expense over the\n",
      "various production job orders according to the amount of time spent by\n",
      "the workmen at an hourly rate. This rate is easily calculated, and was\n",
      "established by dividing the total expense for any period by the total\n",
      "number of hours spent on productive work for the same period, reducing\n",
      "the rate of distribution to so much per hour. If 100 hours of labor\n",
      "were spent on a productive job, the cost of the wages paid the workman\n",
      "for this time was not considered, the expense to be borne by the job\n",
      "being figured at the hourly rate for the 100 hours. It will be seen\n",
      "that this is hardly an equitable arrangement, and to rectify a serious\n",
      "defect in the method, some adjustment must be made:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) The inability to fix a standard for the efficiency of the labor\n",
      "lays the man-hour rate open to criticism. Could this be done, this\n",
      "method would in many cases prove a very equitable way of distributing\n",
      "expense. It will, however, be seen at once that as it is, a skilled\n",
      "workman carries no more expense than an apprentice boy, and if both\n",
      "work on a productive job a full week, the expense in either case is the\n",
      "same regardless of the wages paid. This is hardly a fair proposition.\n",
      "Either the apprentice's time must be accepted as standard and the\n",
      "skilled workman considered twice as efficient in work-hours, or _vice\n",
      "versâ_. To do this would lead to endless complications, yet the\n",
      "quantity and quality of the output between these two classes of labor\n",
      "should be considered and adjusted in some way so that the injustice\n",
      "done the manufacturing cost may be corrected. But this is not an easy\n",
      "matter to regulate, and means extra work on the part of the cost\n",
      "clerks in recording the time spent on job work and adjusting these\n",
      "inequalities in the labor.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) The man-hour rate requires that the hours worked be carefully\n",
      "recorded and totaled, as well as the cost. Many concerns with heavy\n",
      "pay-rolls to be apportioned over a large number of job orders, ignore\n",
      "the footing of the long columns of hours and fractions, and use only\n",
      "the totals of labor cost, which are of course necessary for entry in\n",
      "the commercial books. It is obvious that in doing this an immense\n",
      "amount of clerical labor is saved. The man-hour method requires that\n",
      "both hours and labor cost should be recorded and totaled--a double\n",
      "operation and duplication of work, which, unless it can be simplified,\n",
      "should be avoided, as it means time and unnecessary expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "=9. Machine-Hour Rate Method.= This machine-rate plan of distributing\n",
      "expense was designed to meet the needs of a shop where the product is\n",
      "largely the result of a machine or tool operation, rather than the\n",
      "labor of the mechanic himself. It somewhat resembles the man-hour plan\n",
      "in that the rate of distributing expense is reduced to an hourly rate\n",
      "for the time the machine is working on the job instead of the time of\n",
      "the operator. Each machine is intended to have its own rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "The method of arriving at the machine rate is easily understood, and\n",
      "reduces itself to the item of depreciation on the original cost price\n",
      "of the machine with its shafting, belting, tools, and installation cost\n",
      "figured at, say, 5%, the power to operate machine at an estimated cost\n",
      "per horse-power, ordinary repairs, divided by the number of hours the\n",
      "machine is estimated to be in operation for the same period; this will\n",
      "give the hourly rate of cost to operate. Some mechanical engineers\n",
      "advocate including in the above cost, interest on the investment at\n",
      "6%, also insurance and taxes; and by others, the value of the floor\n",
      "space occupied by the machine is also included; but in all these latter\n",
      "points referred to, engineers greatly differ in opinion, and it is\n",
      "generally decided by each manufacturer for himself according to his own\n",
      "ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the question of the value of machine rates there is probably more\n",
      "argument by mechanical engineers and accountants than on any question\n",
      "in factory accounting; in fact, engineers themselves are very far\n",
      "apart in their opinions and do not seem to agree among themselves.\n",
      "Accountants generally are inclined to take a somewhat different view of\n",
      "the situation from our mechanical friends. While it is admitted there\n",
      "is good argument for both positions, it is to be remembered that we are\n",
      "considering the question of machine rates as a means of distributing\n",
      "the expense account, and it seems to be the prevailing opinion among\n",
      "accountants that as such it is found wanting. While, theoretically,\n",
      "it is undoubtedly the correct solution of the problem, it is more\n",
      "often found in practice to be a case of a \"distribution that does not\n",
      "distribute,\" and for this reason is not used by the very class of\n",
      "factories and machine works for which it was designed and intended to\n",
      "benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us consider in detail a few of the objections that may be raised to\n",
      "the machine-rate method:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) It will be noticed there are other expenses in the shop than\n",
      "that of operating the machines and not covered at all by the machine\n",
      "expense. Machine rates are absolutely worthless for bench labor and\n",
      "the assembling room, for these two must also share in carrying the\n",
      "shop burden. Not to do so would be manifestly unfair. It is therefore\n",
      "necessary that a second distribution must be made entirely different in\n",
      "its calculation, to handle this undistributed expense not covered by\n",
      "the machine rates, which means two different operations for the same\n",
      "shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "This necessitates two different time records to be kept, one card\n",
      "for each machine showing jobs worked on and hours idle, and another\n",
      "time card for the workman. Is is easy to appreciate that this double\n",
      "operation greatly increases the clerical work in the shop, besides two\n",
      "sets of entries by the cost clerks, and more detail for all concerned.\n",
      "If a method can be found which requires but one time record to be kept,\n",
      "this double process can be done away with and the duplication of work\n",
      "avoided.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) The principal factor in the calculation of the machine rate, in\n",
      "fact, the real key to a successful calculation, is in establishing a\n",
      "standard of work-hours for each machine. It is noted that the higher\n",
      "the standard, the lower will be the rate, and the lower the hours\n",
      "operated, the higher will be the rate; in other words, when the\n",
      "machine is idle in excess of the standard, the rate changes. In some\n",
      "shops where the output is a stable product, always in demand, and the\n",
      "machine in continuous operation, a good estimate may be made, but in\n",
      "most shops a machine is frequently idle on account of \"no work\" or\n",
      "\"laid up\" for repairs the same as is its operator. The practice in most\n",
      "shops is such that it is extremely difficult to estimate ahead what the\n",
      "work-hours of a machine will be, and it resolves itself generally into\n",
      "an intelligent guess with two estimators far apart in their estimates,\n",
      "yet a satisfactory distribution requires a standard which will work out\n",
      "in figures close to the actual facts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who can successfully estimate ahead for any time the activity of each\n",
      "machine in a large factory? Our factory engineers are at wide variance\n",
      "on this point. One authority says \"full time,\" 300 days a year, is the\n",
      "proper basis for calculation. It would seem as if this were rather an\n",
      "unusual position to take; it apparently being his belief that the time\n",
      "idle would be offset by the time the machine was operated overtime, or\n",
      "else he expected the machinery once put in motion to neither shut down,\n",
      "nor break down. Either appears to be rather a dangerous assumption on\n",
      "which to base a careful calculation for rate of distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another engineer says 80% of a full day will be found to be the\n",
      "maximum, and further adds: \"It will doubtless fall much below that\n",
      "figure.\" One naturally asks \"How much lower?\" There is quite a large\n",
      "field of figures to choose from between an 80% activity and a dead\n",

      "=10. The Percent Method.= A third plan of distribution, commonly\n",

      "outlined, in which the time employed was the basis of operation, in\n",
      "that the rate of distribution is a percentage on the direct labor cost\n",
      "of the product, which is, of course, commensurate with the amount of\n",

      "expense figured on direct labor would prove the most reliable.\n",
      "\n",
      "This method is based on the principle that the production of each\n",
      "department of a plant should shoulder its own expense, and also a share\n",
      "of the general expense. In other words, the cost of the output from the\n",
      "_Blacksmith Department_, for instance, would be the total productive\n",
      "labor of the department, plus the material used, plus the operating\n",
      "expense of the department, plus its share of the general expense of\n",
      "the whole plant. It is only necessary, then, to establish the relation\n",
      "between the productive labor and the expense, and express the same in\n",
      "a percentage. It is immaterial how many departments or processes there\n",
      "may be in the factory; this relation should be found in each case,\n",
      "based on its own productive labor and expense, each department having\n",
      "its own percentage ascertained from its own actual conditions; no\n",
      "estimating about it. The expense, then, is figured on the labor cost.\n",
      "If, in the _Blacksmith Department_ already referred to, it is found\n",
      "that the expense at which the department is operated is one-fourth\n",
      "of its total productive pay-roll for the same period, it is at once\n",
      "apparent that if to the labor cost of every productive job, 25% is\n",
      "added for shop expense, the total of these expense items added will\n",
      "equal the total expense of the department. In other words, the shop\n",

      "realize its superiority, and it can be recommended for many reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) It is based on actual figures, easily extracted from the regular\n",
      "books of account, and which are a true statement of fact; no guess-work\n",
      "or estimating about it. There is no better way to figure what is to be,\n",
      "than to use results of what can be conclusively demonstrated already\n",
      "has been.\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) It can be used in any manufacturing plant, or in all the\n",
      "departments of the same plant, thereby insuring uniformity of method,\n",
      "which is always desired. No argument is necessary to convince that two\n",
      "methods in the same factory are undesirable when one can be found that\n",
      "is satisfactory.\n",
      "\n",
      "(c) It accomplishes its purpose--it distributes. If it is found\n",
      "that factory conditions are changing, the percentages used may also\n",
      "be changed so as to increase the amount of expense distributed, or\n",
      "diminish it, as necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "(d) It requires less work for the cost accountant. The man-hour plan\n",
      "requires the hours worked to be recorded and footed in addition to\n",
      "the labor cost. The machine-rate plan requires not only two different\n",
      "calculations, as already shown, but also necessitates the adding of\n",
      "all the hours worked. The percentage plan requires only the labor cost\n",
      "in money value, and renders the recording and adding of long columns\n",
      "of hours entirely unnecessary, which, as can readily be seen, is an\n",
      "immense saving of labor. In a large plant with an elaborate system of\n",

      "while the labor of porters, oilers, and general workers employed in the\n",
      "shop would be classed as _indirect_. The superintendent of the plant,\n",
      "shop foreman, factory clerks, engineers, firemen, and general workers\n",
      "also belong in the indirect classification. For accounting purposes,\n",
      "indirect labor is divided into two classes--shop indirect and general\n",
      "indirect. Shop foremen and general workers employed exclusively in the\n",

      "operation of the plant, which cannot be charged to individual shops.\n",
      "Such items as heat, light, building maintenance, taxes, insurance, and\n",

      "to the amount used by each, as shown by meters. Even the hourly cost\n",
      "of power for each machine can then be determined. With a shaft-and\n",
      "belt-driven plant the problem of distributing power costs is less\n",
      "simple. When power costs can be distributed accurately to departments,\n",

      "workers. The details of these orders are fully described in another\n",
      "section.\n",
      "\n",
      "When a foreman receives a shop order, his first duty is to ascertain\n",

      "\n",
      "In actual practice, it is usually best to have all requisitions and\n",

      "largely on the class of business for which it is to be used. In some\n",
      "lines, costs must be distributed by both departments and classes of\n",
      "labor; in others, by classes of labor only; sometimes, by classes\n",

      "labored under the restrictive and harassing laws of the Mother\n",
      "Country, and under their administration were goaded and exasperated\n",
      "beyond endurance in many ways, not the least of which was that of\n",
      "being obliged to purchase many manufactured articles from England at\n",
      "extortionate prices--or, if purchased from other countries, still\n",
      "paying taxes to England for the privilege--they rebelled. Determining\n",
      "to buy no more foreign goods, they set out, at first in most clumsy and\n",
      "primitive fashion, to make for themselves such articles as were really\n",
      "necessaries, and, in noble self-denial, to live without those which\n",
      "they could not make for themselves. They doubtless little realized,\n",
      "however, that they were thereby laying the foundations of the greatest\n",
      "manufacturing country in the world. By the principles thus inaugurated,\n",
      "they instituted the first industrial _boycott_ in the history of\n",
      "the country--the one that has had more important and far-reaching\n",
      "influences than anything of the kind before or since.\n",

      "=Industrial Freedom.= While the departure of the Pilgrims for this\n",
      "country, and the making of their homes on the \"stern and rock-bound\n",
      "coast\" of New England, were for the purpose of seeking religious\n",
      "freedom, it is also true that freedom soon meant very much more than\n",
      "this to them; and with a larger conception of their opportunities\n",
      "and possibilities, some of which were in reality forced upon them\n",
      "by adverse circumstances, there came to them the inspiration of\n",
      "_industrial_ as well as _religious freedom_. The world has seen and\n",
      "has given them due credit for the determined and heroic manner in\n",
      "which they went about their self-appointed task; and they have amply\n",
      "demonstrated to posterity their appreciation of and grasp upon the\n",
      "possibilities and conditions, and the breadth and nobility of character\n",
      "which they exhibited in working out the many perplexing problems that\n",
      "confronted them.\n",

      "=Development of American Industrial Enterprises.= American\n",
      "manufacturing came into being with these small beginnings and crude\n",
      "efforts to fashion those common objects of household necessity and\n",
      "daily use, which, although crude and clumsy, yet answered the purpose\n",
      "until supplanted later by those of more improved form and workmanship.\n",
      "These primitive successes led to greater endeavors, and developed into\n",
      "still broader usefulness, when the time came that necessities had been\n",
      "provided for and luxuries were now demanded by the higher plane of\n",
      "living to which the people had in due time advanced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus the crude beginnings and rude surroundings among which the early\n",
      "American mechanic performed his work, were in his own house. Soon he\n",
      "outgrew these primitive facilities, and built small shops, frequently\n",
      "in the garden or back yard of his home. These gradually enlarged.\n",
      "The development of the business demanded increased facilities, and\n",
      "buildings were erected quite independent of the home surroundings,\n",
      "and two or more men were associated as manufacturers. These plants\n",
      "developed and enlarged, and in due course of time became the machine\n",
      "shops and the factories, which have since multiplied many hundreds\n",
      "of times, not only in number and in value, but in influence and\n",
      "importance, until to-day our country stands the foremost manufacturing\n",
      "nation of the world. This is true, not only as to the volume and value\n",
      "of her manufactured productions, but also as to their great range and\n",
      "diversity of kind and usefulness. One by one the American mechanic\n",
      "has taken up the various classes of work formerly monopolized by this\n",
      "country or that, failing perhaps at first, but always progressing\n",
      "and developing, until, by native ingenuity and unflagging energy,\n",
      "all obstacles have been overcome, all difficulties put aside, new\n",
      "industries have come into being, and other \"victories\" of peace \"no\n",
      "less than those of war\" have been added to the laurels of the American\n",
      "mechanic and of his ever-ready and ever-confident partner, the American\n",
      "manufacturer and capitalist. It is to this combination, each confident\n",
      "of and faithful to the abilities and honor of the other, and each\n",
      "acting his part in his own sphere of usefulness, that the immense\n",
      "success of American manufacturing is due.\n",
      "\n",
      "The factories of to-day are the logical results of a natural growth\n",
      "and development of the various branches of business for which they\n",
      "were originally built and organized. As the buildings increased in\n",
      "numbers and dimensions, the methods of construction, the equipment, and\n",
      "the systems by which they were managed, developed methods of greater\n",
      "economy and efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Tools of the Early Mechanic.= The early mechanic had few tools and\n",
      "appliances wherewith to perform his work; and these were crude and\n",
      "primitive, consisting principally of a limited number of hand-tools\n",
      "brought from the Old Country, and occasionally a hand-lathe of modern\n",
      "dimensions and operated by foot-power. But with their few tools and\n",
      "meager facilities, and animated by the condition that \"necessity is\n",
      "the mother of invention,\" these old-time mechanics proceeded with\n",
      "practical common sense and ingenuity to design and construct better\n",
      "tools and machines--which have continually developed, until we have the\n",
      "splendid array of manufacturing machinery seen on every hand to-day.\n",
      "As machinery developed, larger and larger amounts of money had to be\n",
      "expended; and the banker had to be called upon to provide it. Thus the\n",
      "capitalist became the partner of the manufacturer, the one furnishing\n",
      "the mechanical ability and inventive genius for the actual designing\n",
      "and building of machinery and manufactured goods, while the other\n",
      "contributed the money to carry on the work, and the business ability\n",
      "necessary to market the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Relations of Capital and Labor.= In brief, this is the condition\n",
      "to-day. But, says the carping critic, \"there are often hundreds\n",
      "of struggling and hard-working employees where there is one rich\n",
      "manufacturer.\" This may be partly true, although it is a fact\n",
      "beyond dispute that the American mechanic is the best paid workman\n",
      "in the world. It is true that there are hundreds of workmen to one\n",
      "capitalist. Why? The Creator has so ordained that there shall be many\n",
      "of moderate ability, and but few possessing the unusual ability and\n",
      "talent to lead them. So it has ever been since the days of Moses, and\n",
      "so it probably will ever continue to be. Doestick's regiment composed\n",
      "entirely of colonels was a manifest absurdity, and so intended as an\n",
      "illustration of a well-known and natural condition that should be\n",
      "realized by every reasonable and thoughtful man who considers these\n",
      "questions.\n",

      "this great country and providing for the vast volume of trade that\n",
      "goes abroad, by the modern manufacturing plants equipped with all that\n",
      "is latest and best in machinery for every conceivable purpose, it\n",
      "should not be forgotten that, as the very basis and foundation of the\n",
      "whole, stands the modern _machine tool_, and that it is principally\n",
      "to the great and important development of this that we owe primarily\n",
      "our industrial growth and prosperity as a manufacturing nation. To the\n",
      "machine tool may easily be traced the gradual but continued upward\n",
      "tendency of the mechanic and his methods, from the hard physical toil\n",
      "and small pay of the early days, to the immeasurably lighter exertion\n",
      "and increased compensation made possible by the highly developed\n",
      "condition of the automatic machines of the present day. It has been\n",
      "an oft-repeated victory of \"mind over matter,\" wherein _brains_ have\n",
      "won where _hands_ made but little advance; _ideas_ have developed\n",
      "wonderful mechanisms that have revolutionized the earlier methods of\n",
      "manufacturing and raised the standard of mechanical excellence beyond\n",
      "what was thought possible years ago, and at the same time reduced the\n",
      "cost to a fraction of its former amount.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here, again, the capitalist furnished the means whereby the practical\n",
      "realization of the ingenious designs of the mechanic's fertile brain\n",
      "became possible, and the successful combination of capital and labor\n",
      "brought success to both.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Combinations of Capital.= But here comes our critical labor agitator\n",
      "again with the comment: \"It is all very well to talk about the amicable\n",
      "relations of capital and labor, and how each ought to help the other,\n",
      "but how about the great combinations of capital that we ordinarily\n",
      "call \"trusts\"? To give a correct and intelligent, as well as a fair\n",
      "and truthful answer to this question, we must know the _conditions_\n",
      "under which the combination is formed, the _plan_ upon which it is\n",
      "organized, and the _object_ of its formation. As these are not given,\n",
      "we must assume the conditions of some well-known combination. Let it be\n",
      "the United States Steel Corporation. One of the foremost men in this\n",
      "combination has defined his position on the subject, and in so doing\n",
      "has outlined the policy of the corporation, by saying:\n",
      "\n",
      " \"Any combination of capital which operates, _first_, to prevent\n",
      " competition; _second_, to increase the price of the product; and\n",
      " _third_, to reduce the wages of the workmen, is working under a trio\n",
      " of wrong principles that sooner or later will bring about disaster.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Let us see how the actual operation of this combination of capital\n",
      "really works out in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      " _First_--The Steel Corporation has never sought to prevent\n",
      " competition. Steel mills, large and small, have operated when, where,\n",
      " and how they pleased, with no interference from the Steel Corporation.\n",
      "\n",
      " _Second_--The price of steel has not been increased; on the contrary,\n",
      " it has been greatly reduced under its management. Thirty years ago a\n",
      " very indifferent quality of machine steel cost from 8 to 12 cents per\n",
      " pound. To-day ordinary machine steel of a much better quality than\n",
      " that mentioned above can be had for 2 cents a pound or less.\n",
      "\n",
      " _Third_--The wages of workmen have not only not been reduced, but have\n",
      " actually been doubled since the labor troubles in the steel mills\n",
      " known as the \"Homestead Strike\" (1892). The Steel Corporation has\n",
      " gone much further than to double the wages of the steel workers. They\n",
      " have made it possible for the workmen to become partners in the great\n",
      " work of the corporation, by obligating themselves to sell to their\n",
      " workmen a certain amount each year of stock in the corporation, so\n",
      " that the men who labor in the mills may also become part owners and\n",
      " participate in the dividends resulting from their work on exactly the\n",
      " same percentage as the capitalist himself does.\n",
      "\n",
      " Our critic comes back to the charge by saying that \"the Steel\n",
      " Corporation has bought up many steel plants in various parts of the\n",
      " country, and added them to its already enormous properties.\" Quite\n",
      " true. And for what purpose? Let us see what they do with these plants.\n",
      " How do they manage this part of the business? What is their plan of\n",
      " working? The conditions were these: Before the advent of the United\n",
      " States Steel Corporation, there were many isolated steel manufacturing\n",
      " plants, each being equipped for the making of a number of kinds of\n",
      " steel products--for instance, steel railroad rails, structural steel,\n",
      " merchant bar steel, steel boiler-plates, steel tank-plates, and so\n",
      " on. The equipment necessary for producing these different forms of\n",
      " steel was very expensive; and inasmuch as a considerable portion of\n",
      " this equipment for some particular kind of product would necessarily\n",
      " be idle on account of the fluctuations of trade, the expense burden\n",
      " was abnormally high on account of this idle equipment. How has this\n",
      " condition been handled by the Steel Corporation? This has been the\n",
      " plan: Suppose they have purchased five plants, each making the\n",
      " five classes of product indicated above, and working under the\n",
      " disadvantages of a variety of products. These plants are examined,\n",
      " and inventories made of their equipments. It is then decided which\n",
      " mill is best adapted for making each one of the five classes of\n",
      " products. Then there is a redistribution of the equipment of the\n",
      " plants, placing in the plant selected for it all that in the several\n",
      " plants is adapted to a certain product; removing all the machinery\n",
      " from this plant that is not adapted to the particular product to be\n",
      " turned out, to be distributed among the other plants according to the\n",
      " particular class of products for which each one is designed. Thus\n",
      " each plant is equipped to turn out the single class of product which\n",
      " is most appropriate for it, by drawing upon the other plants for such\n",
      " machinery as they have which may supplement its own in this line.\n",
      "\n",
      " By this plan, each plant makes but one class of product. Having the\n",
      " best machinery from all the plants for this purpose, and concentrating\n",
      " its energies on a single class, it is enabled not only to turn out a\n",
      " better product, but to turn it out much more economically than before.\n",
      " As the workmen become more expert on their single line of product,\n",
      " they work more efficiently and consequently earn higher wages.\n",
      " All these conditions, producing an economical output, enable the\n",
      " manufacturers to reduce the selling price.\n",
      "\n",
      " The conditions of economy brought about in the management of the\n",
      " manufacturing operations and in marketing the product, are very\n",
      " marked when a large number of plants operate under one general head.\n",
      " Again, with the immense amount of capital at the disposal of such a\n",
      " corporation, it is enabled to secure the services of the best experts,\n",
      " and the most valuable processes in existence.\n",
      "\n",
      " There are many other advantages, not only to the corporation and its\n",
      " employees, but to the users of its products, and so to the general\n",
      " public, when a combination of capital is _honestly made and honestly\n",
      " administered_.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Betterment of Industrial Conditions.= What has been said of the Steel\n",
      "Corporation as to favoring of employees, has been duplicated in various\n",
      "ways by different manufacturers all over the country. Factory sites\n",
      "have been beautified by landscape gardening, and trees and shrubbery\n",
      "have made the surroundings of working men and women pleasant and\n",
      "attractive. Land has been purchased, and workingmen's homes built\n",
      "and rented to them at fair rates. Factory dining rooms are provided;\n",
      "reading rooms, libraries, gymnasiums, clubs, and social organizations\n",
      "are inaugurated; emergency hospitals or \"first aid\" rooms are arranged,\n",
      "with all or nearly all these services free except that provided in\n",
      "dining rooms, which is furnished at actual cost. More recently, a firm\n",
      "in Connecticut announces that it will furnish free medical attendance\n",
      "to all its employees and their families.\n",
      "\n",
      "Schools have been established for apprentices, wherein they receive\n",
      "such technical instruction as may be necessary to their success in\n",
      "the trade they are learning--and this, not only without expense to\n",
      "themselves or to their parents, but they are paid by the hour for time\n",
      "spent in their school work, the same as for their time in the shop.\n",
      "\n",
      "To foster a practical interest in the work of the shops, many concerns\n",

      "the capitalist who manufactures and sells, and of the employee by the\n",
      "efforts of whose hand and brain the products are being turned out, are\n",
      "each year being recognized and in a very large majority of cases are\n",
      "being acted upon in good faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Methods of Modern Manufacturing.= In former times, machines were\n",
      "built one at a time or in very small lots. Parts were made and fitted\n",
      "to the particular machine to which they belonged; and while the same\n",
      "general form and dimensions were practically maintained, there was no\n",
      "attempt made to render the several parts so exact as to fit upon any\n",
      "other machine than the one for which they were intended. Systems of\n",
      "gauges had not been developed, and the planer was yet a comparatively\n",
      "new tool; much work was still done by hand, the hammer, the cold\n",
      "chisel, and the file being the chief reliance of a large majority of\n",
      "machinists. This was the state of the machine shop and its methods\n",
      "nearly up to the year 1800.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Interchangeable Manufacturing.= The use of milling cutters and the\n",
      "commencement of practically interchangeable manufacturing, came into\n",
      "machine shop practice at nearly the same time. It has been said that\n",
      "\"but for the milling machine, there would have been no such thing as\n",
      "interchangeable manufacturing.\" It might be said with quite as much\n",
      "truth, that if the system of interchangeable manufacturing had not been\n",
      "conceived, there would have been little need for the milling machine.\n",
      "Each, to a great extent, depended very much upon the development of the\n",
      "other--and upon a third factor, the conception and development of the\n",
      "method of handling work (particularly small parts) in jigs and fixtures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Milling cutters were made in America by one of the early machinists, a\n",
      "Frenchman named Vaucanson, who died in 1782. A sample of these had a\n",
      "hexagonal instead of a round hole, and the pitch of the teeth was very\n",
      "fine, so that the cutter resembled a saw rather than those at present\n",
      "in use. It is said that a man by the name of Bodmer, in Manchester,\n",
      "England, had made a milling machine in 1824.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is altogether probable that Eli Whitney, the inventor of the cotton\n",
      "gin, had built and used milling machines previous to this date, as\n",
      "the following item of mechanical history would seem to indicate. In\n",
      "January, 1798, Eli Whitney received from the United States Government\n",
      "an order to furnish ten thousand muskets, of which four thousand were\n",
      "to be delivered in one year, and the balance in two years. Mr. Whitney\n",
      "went at the undertaking in a very thorough and systematic manner.\n",
      "He first developed a water power; then erected suitable buildings;\n",
      "considered and developed ways and means for a larger and better product\n",
      "than had previously been realized; designed and built machinery to\n",
      "effect it; and trained workmen to a degree of skill necessary to\n",
      "success in their new employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difficulties which Mr. Whitney encountered and the obstacles\n",
      "which he had to overcome, were so much greater than he anticipated\n",
      "that it was really eight years instead of two before he had succeeded\n",
      "in completing the government order for the ten thousand muskets.\n",
      "However, the progress which he had made in this new enterprise, and the\n",
      "character of the product which he turned out and delivered, were so\n",
      "satisfactory to the government officials that Congress treated him with\n",
      "the greatest courtesy and consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "His shops were situated in the city of New Haven, Conn., and soon\n",
      "became the Mecca of government officials, manufacturers, traveling\n",
      "notables, and foreigners, who had heard of this wonderful American\n",
      "mechanic and came to see his work for themselves--to find that the\n",
      "system, the machines, and the tools which he had perfected were well\n",
      "worth the journey. His innovations in the manufacture of arms formed as\n",
      "great an epoch in mechanical history as had his invention of the cotton\n",
      "gin.\n",
      "\n",
      "Jigs and fixtures were among his equipment; and it is altogether\n",
      "probable that milling machines were also in use, since he must have had\n",
      "practical knowledge of the utility of the milling cutter at this time,\n",
      "as it is generally assumed that the first practical use of the milling\n",
      "machine was in the making of parts of muskets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The buildings which Mr. Whitney erected for his use were substantial\n",
      "stone structures, and stand in a part of the city called in his\n",
      "honor \"Whitneyville.\" They form a part of the extensive plant of the\n",
      "Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "At this point and at this early day, therefore, was inaugurated the\n",
      "modern system of interchangeable manufacturing--or the manufacturing,\n",
      "in large numbers, of duplicate parts, within such a limited degree\n",
      "of variation as to admit of their ready interchangeability with\n",
      "one another. The system was not one that would be confined to the\n",
      "manufacture of arms, but was adaptable to the production of all kinds\n",
      "of small and moderate-sized machinery, and was the initial effort\n",
      "which in due time revolutionized the then existing shop methods, and\n",
      "which has since built up the American system of manufacturing to the\n",
      "proud distinction of being superior to anything of the kind in other\n",
      "manufacturing countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the operations of modern manufacturing, the principal object sought\n",
      "is to turn out the product economically and accurately. To produce\n",
      "these results economically, the parts must be produced very rapidly.\n",
      "To produce them rapidly, not only must there be a very complete and\n",
      "efficient equipment of machines, attachments, tools, jigs, fixtures,\n",
      "and gauges or measuring devices, but there must also be a very complete\n",
      "system of shop methods by which the operation of this equipment is\n",
      "carried on.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has been well said that \"the man in whose brain the manufacturing\n",
      "system was born was he who first took a piece of scrap iron and drilled\n",
      "two holes in it, to guide a drill in making another piece with two\n",
      "holes in it the same distance apart as in the first piece.\" The men\n",
      "who now fill our drafting rooms and tool rooms, and who devise and\n",
      "construct tools for the production of interchangeable metal parts,\n",
      "are his descendants. They have made possible the manufacture of the\n",
      "breech-loading gun, the typewriter, the cheap sewing machine, the cash\n",
      "register, the machine-made watch, the automobile, as well as a thousand\n",
      "and one other mechanical articles, machines, and devices which form an\n",
      "integral part of our twentieth-century civilization.\n",
      "\n",
      "To render these systems efficient and economical for these purposes,\n",

      "distinct operations to complete it. But, as each single operation is\n",

      "=Modern Meaning of Shop Management.= The present understanding of the\n",
      "term _Shop Management_ is quite different from the sense in which it\n",
      "was used years ago. Formerly the management of the shop was vested\n",
      "in a _superintendent_ whose duties consisted in purchasing material,\n",
      "inspecting it when it was received, turning it over to the foreman,\n",
      "and in a general way looking after the work as it was being performed.\n",
      "In addition to these duties, he frequently handled the selling of the\n",
      "product, the collection of accounts, and the proper provision for\n",
      "meeting the pay-roll on pay-days. He also had a general supervision\n",
      "over the grounds and buildings and their care and maintenance, as well\n",
      "as the provision for power, lighting, and heating. By this arrangement\n",
      "of duties, it will be seen that comparatively little time was devoted\n",
      "to actual shop operations, and much time to different lines of duties\n",
      "that might more economically and often quite as efficiently be\n",
      "performed by assistants at a much lower rate of pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the modern methods of shop management, all these things are changed.\n",
      "The specialization of workmanship, the division of duties, the limiting\n",
      "of responsibilities--each restricted within narrow limits by sharply\n",
      "defined regulations--have reduced the variety of operations of the\n",
      "workman, and of responsibilities and duties of the men who direct\n",
      "manufacturing work.\n",
      "\n",
      "We find the purchasing of material and supplies in charge of a\n",
      "_Purchasing Agent_. We find these purchases checked by a _Receiving\n",
      "Clerk_, turned over to a _Storekeeper_, and subject to examination by\n",
      "a regular _Inspector_. They are then put into the storeroom, whence\n",
      "they are drawn as needed for the different departments, the foremen of\n",
      "which sign definite orders for such kinds, quantities, and qualities\n",
      "as may be needed, specifying the purposes for which they are to be\n",
      "used or the particular orders to which they are to be charged. When\n",
      "issued, they are receipted for by the person receiving them. All\n",
      "this is conducted with the same regard for business rules as if the\n",
      "foreman were making a purchase on his own account and paying for the\n",
      "goods. We find the selling of the product in the hands of an expert\n",
      "_Sales Manager_, often assisted by a corps of engineers, draftsmen,\n",
      "bookkeepers, and clerks, numbering more persons than the entire\n",

      "the usual type of manufacturing plant, built, organized, and managed at\n",
      "the present day. The plan of such a plant is given in Fig. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "In planning a plant of this character, provision must primarily be made\n",
      "for the various departments for the following purposes:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. An _Engineering Department_, wherein the machines forming the\n",
      " product may be designed and the drawings made for the various classes\n",
      " of mechanics who are to perform the work of turning out the product.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. A _Pattern-Making Department_, in which the necessary patterns are\n",
      " made for use in the foundry for producing the castings.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. A _Forge Shop_, capable of producing such forgings as are required\n",
      " in the machinery to be built.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. An _Iron and Brass Foundry_, in which may be produced the rough\n",
      " castings of the parts that are to enter into the machines constituting\n",
      " the product.\n",
      "\n",
      " 5. _Manufacturing Departments_, in which all parts (large and small)\n",
      " of the product are made from the rough stock--such as castings,\n",
      " forgings, bar stock, and the like, to the completed parts ready for\n",
      " assembling.\n",
      "\n",
      " 6. _Assembling and Erecting Departments_, in which individual parts\n",
      " may be assembled into groups of related parts, and these erected into\n",
      " complete machines.\n",
      "\n",
      " 7. A _Power Plant_, containing the proper equipment for furnishing\n",
      " the necessary power for driving the machinery in these various\n",
      " departments, and for providing lighting and heating facilities for the\n",
      " plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 1. Typical Layout of a Manufacturing Plant.]\n",
      "\n",
      " The _General Office_ of the concern is of course understood; but, as\n",
      " it cannot properly be classed with departments of the plant, it is not\n",
      " included in the above enumeration.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the above list of principal departments, there will be\n",
      "the following--quite as necessary, but secondary in importance:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. The _Transportation System_, including shop and yard tracks and\n",
      " cars, elevators, cranes, hoists, and all similar appliances for\n",
      " handling material.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. The _Tool Room_, for making tools, jigs, and fixtures, and for\n",
      " properly storing them in a convenient manner for issuing when they are\n",
      " called for.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. An _Experimental Room_, which all progressive concerns find\n",
      " necessary in the development of their product.\n",
      "\n",
      " 4. The _Store-Room_, in which are stored the raw material and the\n",
      " purchased stock, either partly or completely manufactured, which are\n",
      " issued to the different departments as needed for their daily routine\n",
      " work.\n",
      "\n",
      " 5. The _Finished Parts Store-Room_, in which the smaller parts of the\n",
      " product, as fast as they are completed, are stored and held until\n",
      " wanted for the process of assembling.\n",
      "\n",
      " 6. The _Pattern Storage Room_. In this department, often occupying\n",
      " several floors of a building specially constructed for this purpose,\n",
      " are stored all patterns for the iron and brass foundries, and also\n",
      " those sent to outside foundries for malleable and steel castings.\n",
      "\n",
      " 7. The _Carpenter Shop_. This is a general utility department making\n",
      " boxes and crates for shipping; doing carpenter work in keeping the\n",
      " grounds and buildings in proper repair, and making necessary changes\n",
      " therein; making and repairing flasks for the foundry; and similar work.\n",
      "\n",
      " 8. The _Paint Shop_. A small room serving little more than as a\n",
      " storeroom for paints and painters' materials, as their work is\n",
      " principally done at various points in the shops, wherever the machines\n",
      " or parts may happen to be.\n",
      "\n",
      " 9. The _Shipping Room_. In a plant building large machinery, the\n",
      " shipping room is simply an office for the shipper, the physical work\n",
      " of shipping being done in the shops, wherever the machine may happen\n",
      " to be at the time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Referring to the plan given in Fig. 1, it will be seen that the\n",
      "Administration Building is placed in substantially the center of the\n",
      "front line of the plant. The first and second floors of such a building\n",
      "are usually devoted to administrative, commercial, and accounting\n",
      "purposes. The upper floor is usually occupied by the Engineering\n",
      "Department and drafting room.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three Manufacturing Buildings numbered 1, 2, and 3 are devoted\n",
      "to the various operations of making the parts of which the machinery\n",
      "product is composed. These parts are then sent to the Erecting Building\n",
      "(No. 4).\n",
      "\n",
      "The system of shop transportation consists primarily of shop tracks and\n",
      "cars, and is extended to the yard, being so designed as to connect all\n",
      "buildings of the plant with one another and with the yard. It also\n",
      "reaches the railroad tracks at numerous points. Overhead traveling\n",
      "cranes cover the manufacturing buildings, and extend into the erecting\n",
      "building far enough to form a connection with the large traveling crane\n",
      "serving it, by which the large parts of machines are carried from place\n",
      "to place as may be required by the erecting men. This crane serves to\n",
      "load the finished machines upon the railroad cars, when they are to be\n",
      "shipped, the railroad track being extended within the building for this\n",
      "purpose, as shown in Fig. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tool Room is given as central a location as possible, and would\n",
      "naturally be near the junction of building No. 2 with the erecting\n",
      "building.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Experimental Room has no particular place, but is frequently so\n",
      "placed as to be away from the active manufacturing operations, with\n",
      "which it is liable to interfere if too closely related.\n",
      "\n",
      "The general Store-Room for purchased material may be in the erecting\n",
      "building, but is frequently located, for convenience of communication,\n",
      "nearer the general offices--as for instance, in front of building No. 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smaller parts are stored in a Finished Parts Store-Room, usually\n",
      "located in this building. Thence they are issued to the Assembling\n",
      "Department as required.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pattern Shop building will often be composed of three floors.\n",
      "On the ground floor will be the Carpenter Shop and flask making and\n",
      "repairing work. On the second floor will be the pattern-making shop,\n",
      "and on the third floor will be the pattern storage rooms. A large\n",
      "elevator serves all three floors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Paint Shop is sometimes located in one of the manufacturing\n",
      "buildings or the erecting building; but as the painting of machine\n",
      "parts and complete machines is generally done in any one of the\n",
      "departments where the work may be, and the paint shop is hardly more\n",
      "than a storeroom for paints, a due consideration of the question of\n",
      "fire protection would indicate that it had better be placed in a small\n",
      "building entirely detached from all manufacturing buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Power House, in the former method of transmitting power by shafting\n",
      "and belting, was located as nearly as possible in the center of the\n",
      "space over which power was to be distributed. Since the advent of\n",
      "electricity and its common use for transmitting power, the question of\n",
      "the location of the power house is relieved from this condition; it\n",
      "may be located at the point most convenient to railroad facilities for\n",
      "receiving fuel, or for obtaining the necessary water for boilers, for\n",
      "fire purposes, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a plant manufacturing small machines or a kind of product which\n",
      "is shipped in small quantities, it is obvious that the Shipping Room\n",
      "must be convenient to the point from which these goods are to be\n",
      "taken by railroad cars, by boat, or by teams. If most of the shipping\n",
      "is of large machines or articles which must be handled by cranes,\n",
      "the railroad tracks will be run into the erecting building, and the\n",
      "machines loaded there, in order to avoid the expense of extra handling\n",
      "and moving them. This is the arrangement shown in Fig. 1. In this case\n",
      "the shipping room may be in the Administration Building, so as to be\n",
      "convenient to the other office departments. In some kinds of business\n",
      "it is convenient to have the shipping room and general storeroom near\n",
      "each other, as there is considerable business done in each that is\n",
      "quite closely related to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Iron and Brass Foundry is usually located at some distance from\n",
      "the manufacturing buildings, in order that the latter may be as free\n",
      "as possible from the annoyance of smoke and dust. It is connected\n",
      "with the other departments by the system of shop and yard tracks, and\n",
      "the railroad siding track passes through one end of the building as\n",
      "a matter of convenience in shipping castings. There is also a branch\n",
      "track running along the side of the foundry building for the purpose of\n",
      "delivering coke, coal, moulding sand, pig iron, scrap iron, and other\n",
      "foundry materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "It should be noted that the buildings shown in the plan are located in\n",
      "a compact mass, with considerably less than the usual yard room. In\n",
      "this instance, however, the plan was so drafted to economize space on\n",
      "the drawing. It is the law in some European countries that not over\n",
      "50 per cent of the area of a manufacturing site shall be covered by\n",
      "roofs. Such a law would be of much value in this country, to prevent\n",
      "the crowding of buildings to such an extent as to be unhealthful to\n",
      "employees.\n",
      "\n",
      "While factory buildings are frequently erected of from three to to six\n",
      "floors, the modern tendency is to reduce the number of floors in all\n",
      "shops and manufacturing buildings; and in the case of machine shops,\n",
      "a large majority of them are built of only one floor. Some, however,\n",
      "have wide galleries at the side, by which considerable second-floor\n",
      "space is added; while the central portion remains open to the roof, and\n",
      "supplies ample space for the accommodation of the overhead traveling\n",
      "crane, as well as the necessary added height needed for erecting large\n",
      "machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foundries are necessarily built of a single floor, although there are\n",
      "several in different parts of the country where moulding rooms are\n",
      "located as high as the third floor. This latter arrangement is usually\n",
      "made for brass moulding, rather than for iron moulding.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Organization of a Manufacturing Plant.= Having the design of the\n",
      "plant, and assuming that the required buildings have been erected\n",
      "in accordance with this plan, the next step will be to organize\n",
      "the management both in a general way and also as relates to the\n",
      "various departments usually necessary to inaugurate the business of\n",
      "manufacturing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the scope of this treatise covers only the shop and its management,\n",
      "we need not take up the commercial organization of the company by\n",
      "which it is capitalized and maintained. We shall therefore consider\n",
      "the General Manager as the head of the organization, and proceed to\n",
      "examine the methods usually adopted for the division of authority and\n",
      "responsibilities from him to the actual workmen at the bench, at the\n",
      "machines, and on the floors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chart shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the plan of the organization.\n",
      "Nearly all minor officials and office employees, such as bookkeepers,\n",
      "clerks, stenographers, etc., are omitted from this chart, to avoid\n",
      "confusion and to simplify the understanding of the organization plan\n",
      "and its numerous details.\n",
      "\n",
      "The General Manager has a personal Assistant, and, for his commercial\n",
      "affairs, the service of a commercial Accountant and a Cashier. Other\n",
      "office employees are similar in number, duties, and responsibilities to\n",
      "those in the usual commercial office.\n",
      "\n",
      "By referring to the chart, it will be seen that the organization\n",
      "is divided into two distinctly different parts. First, that of\n",
      "_production_ or _manufacturing proper_; and second, that of _selling_\n",
      "or _marketing_ the output produced.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this case the production division is by far the most numerous and\n",
      "complex. This, however, is not always the case--as, for instance,\n",
      "in the case of a manufacturing concern selling its product through\n",
      "local agents. Frequently the territory over which sales are made is\n",
      "divided along state lines, and a _District Agent_ appointed for each\n",
      "state. These, in turn, appoint the _Local Agents_. This necessitates\n",
      "an organization of hundreds of local agents, supervised by state or\n",
      "district agents, and these in turn by a _General Agent_. Thus a very\n",
      "large organization is built up for disposing of the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 2. Chart Illustrating Plan of Organization of a\n",
      "Typical Manufacturing Plant. Showing channels of authority connecting\n",
      "officials and departments.]\n",
      "\n",
      "Another plan is the employment of _Traveling Canvassers_, each having\n",
      "a certain territory to cover, who make their reports to either state\n",
      "or district agents, or to the general agent located at a central\n",
      "point--sometimes at the factory, but not necessarily so.\n",
      "\n",
      "As competition becomes stronger and net profits smaller, the problem\n",
      "of marketing the product becomes more and more important; greater and\n",
      "more complex selling organizations are necessary; and the expense of\n",
      "selling increases. The advertising organization, or what has come to be\n",
      "known as the _Publicity Department_, is a most important adjunct to the\n",
      "modern manufacturing business; and large amounts of money are annually\n",
      "expended in its maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the case under consideration, the selling of the product is in\n",
      "charge of a _Sales Manager_, who has as his office staff the _Publicity\n",
      "Manager_; the _Preliminary Engineer_, and the draftsmen and estimators\n",
      "who assist him; the _General Salesman_, who is in reality the personal\n",
      "assistant to the Sales Manager; and the _Credit and Collection Clerk_.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Publicity Manager_, sometimes called the _Advertising Manager_,\n",
      "has charge of all advertising of whatever kind, demonstrations at\n",
      "expositions and at agencies, and, in fact, all work that may be\n",
      "properly comprised under the term \"publicity\"--that is, keeping the\n",
      "public informed as to the product of the company and its adaptability\n",
      "to meet the needs of the public in the special lines it manufactures.\n",
      "\n",
      "The _Preliminary Engineer_ is in charge of such engineering matters\n",
      "as are necessary upon new work, or work upon which the Sales Manager\n",
      "desires to estimate. It frequently happens that considerable designing\n",
      "and drawing are necessary in this connection, previous to definite\n",
      "orders being given or contracts signed. It often happens that the\n",
      "product of the concern must be changed in certain details so as to\n",
      "adapt it to the uses of various customers, to the different local\n",
      "conditions under which it is to be used, and to the various purposes\n",
      "for which it is to be used. In case an order is given and contracts\n",
      "signed, the preliminary drawings thus produced become a part of the\n",

      "what manner and through what channels the orders of an official pass to\n",
      "the employees for whose work he is responsible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tracing these lines from the head of the establishment through the\n",
      "various offices and officials to the different departments, we get a\n",
      "fundamental idea of _Shop Management_.\n",
      "\n",
      "This system will be rendered somewhat simpler by reference to\n",
      "the Chart, Fig. 3, which shows the path or official channel of\n",
      "communication and authority from the Superintendent down to the\n",
      "workmen. It also emphasizes the fundamental idea of all official\n",
      "business passing through the officials in charge of intermediate\n",
      "departments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, if the Factory Manager desires a certain thing done, he does\n",
      "not give the order to one of the workmen, nor to a foreman, but to\n",
      "the Superintendent. The Superintendent will give his orders to the\n",
      "foreman of the department wherein the work is to be done. If this is a\n",
      "department in which there are gang bosses, the Foreman will give his\n",
      "orders to the proper gang boss, who will select a suitable workman, or\n",
      "as many of them as may be necessary, and instruct them as to the work,\n",
      "and will personally see that it is performed promptly and in the proper\n",
      "manner. When the work is completed, he will report the fact to the\n",
      "foreman, who will in turn report to the Superintendent, who informs the\n",
      "Factory Manager that his orders have been executed.\n",
      "\n",
      "This process may seem unnecessarily complicated, and in consequence it\n",
      "is sometimes referred to as _red tape_. It is, however, necessary to\n",
      "have a well-defined and properly understood system and channel for all\n",
      "routine business, some of the reasons for which are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      " _First_--it has been said that \"no man can serve two masters,\" and\n",
      " this is quite true in all questions of shop management. Every loyal\n",
      " workman has learned by precept and tradition to look to his immediate\n",
      " superior for all orders and instructions relating to his work, and he\n",
      " naturally and properly resents any attempt to ignore or belittle his\n",
      " legitimate \"boss.\"\n",
      "\n",
      " _Second_--As the efficiency of the workmen depends to a great extent\n",
      " upon their loyalty to the management, and as that loyalty can be\n",
      " secured and maintained only by a spirit of justice and fair-dealing to\n",
      " all, including officials and workmen, all authority and responsibility\n",
      " should be sharply defined and properly limited, to the end that the\n",
      " business and work may proceed in an orderly and efficient manner; that\n",
      " all officials and workmen may know when they are within their proper\n",
      " limit of rights; and doing their duties without fear of overstepping\n",
      " their due bounds or interfering with the rights and privileges of\n",
      " their fellows.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nearly all rules are subject to some exceptions, and the above have\n",
      "theirs. The discipline of the shop, or what is sometimes referred to as\n",
      "the _police regulations_, are expected to be enforced by _all officials\n",
      "at all times_.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two of these exceptions are of such a general nature and application\n",
      "that they are here noted.\n",
      "\n",
      " _First_--Any official noticing an infraction of the discipline of the\n",
      " plant may call the attention of the employee offending, without regard\n",
      " to the department in which he works, and require him at once to cease\n",
      " violating the rules. But the official should, as soon as possible,\n",
      " report the matter to the head of the department in which the offending\n",
      " employee works.\n",
      "\n",
      " _Second_--Any official noticing work being wrongly done, or material\n",
      " wasted, or machinery obviously injured, or the safety of the workmen,\n",
      " the building, or the machinery endangered, may peremptorily order\n",
      " the action to cease, and at once report the fact to the head of the\n",
      " department or to the Superintendent, as he may judge proper.\n",

      "\n",
      "=Official Communications.= For ordinary communications other than\n",
      "General or Special Orders, Production Orders, letters, etc., a written\n",
      "form should be habitually used. The usual form is shown in Fig. 4.\n",
      "These forms are put up in pads of alternate sheets of white and\n",
      "light-tinted paper, the former being perforated at the top so as to be\n",
      "readily torn out while the tinted sheet remains fast at the stub. Both\n",
      "sheets are printed with the same form, and all are serially numbered\n",
      "in pairs of one white and one tinted sheet. Carbon paper is used, the\n",
      "white sheet being written upon and the tinted one receiving the carbon\n",
      "impression. Each official is supplied with these pads, and by their use\n",
      "he always retains a copy of any memorandum or communication he makes\n",
      "to another official or department. The serial numbers are intended\n",
      "to aid in the identification of any memorandum that may have become\n",
      "somewhat illegible. The use of these blanks saves any misunderstanding\n",
      "that might occur from giving and receiving verbal orders; and serves to\n",
      "prevent errors and mistakes, and to fix the responsibility for their\n",
      "occurrence upon the party in error.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Successful Management.= The spirit of shop management should always\n",
      "be a spirit of _leadership_. This cannot usually be obtained unless\n",
      "the manager possesses natural ability as a leader. Successful military\n",
      "chieftains are examples of this condition. They _lead_ the men instead\n",
      "of _driving_ them, and the result is a condition of enthusiastic\n",
      "loyalty.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also quite as necessary that a leader should be a practical man\n",
      "with sound technical training and practical experience in the business\n",
      "which he undertakes to manage. If he is not thus equipped for his\n",
      "duties, the facts soon become apparent to his subordinates, and his\n",
      "reputation suffers accordingly. The workmen lose confidence in his\n",
      "leadership, and lack enthusiasm in the performance of their duties,\n",
      "going about their work in a listless and perfunctory manner that is\n",
      "very detrimental to the efficiency of the plant.\n",
      "\n",

      "ability to judge men and their capacities for various duties. To\n",
      "get always the right man for the position, the machine, or the job,\n",
      "is a valuable trait in any man who is to direct the work of even\n",
      "a moderate-sized establishment. The larger the plant and the more\n",
      "diversified the business carried on in it, the more valuable and\n",
      "indispensable this characteristic will become. The manager who is\n",
      "continually or frequently changing his subordinate officials, and\n",
      "consequently producing changes in the working force, will always find\n",
      "his duties arduous, and will also find it well-nigh impossible to get\n",
      "the plant up to the degree of efficiency that is to be reasonably\n",
      "expected. The volume of output will continually fall below the normal\n",
      "point, and the quality of the work will also deteriorate. The work\n",
      "of management should be a constant upbuilding of the force, and of\n",
      "development and education along the lines of advancement in the special\n",
      "output of the concern. This cannot be carried on if the composition of\n",
      "the force, or the officials who handle it, are in a transition state of\n",

      "There is, on the part of many officials having charge of men, a\n",
      "propensity to interfere too much with workmen and their work, and thus\n",
      "to hinder rather than help them. While it is quite true that every\n",
      "official from the Gang Boss up to the Factory Manager can, at various\n",
      "times, help the workmen in their allotted tasks by timely advice and\n",
      "suggestions, it is also true that this is a matter that can be easily\n",
      "overdone, until it becomes an annoying nuisance and unnecessarily\n",
      "interferes with the men in the discharge of their legitimate duties.\n",

      "Workmen are quick to discern when suggestions and advice are well meant\n",
      "and instructive, and when they come as a kind of veiled criticism.\n",
      "The official who permits himself to indulge in this sort of dictation\n",
      "soon falls into a practice of _nagging_ that is most exasperating to\n",
      "the men. It is a practice that first weakens and then destroys the\n",
      "official's influence with the men, who obey only from necessity. When\n",
      "this condition exists, the working efficiency of the force is at a very\n",
      "low ebb.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, really helpful advice and suggestions, made in a\n",
      "cheerful manner and from a quite apparent desire to assist workmen,\n",

      "the efficiency of the workmen.\n",

      "Another point on the road to success, is a patient and interested\n",
      "listening to suggestions that workmen have to make, even though it is\n",
      "on trivial matters. It should always be borne in mind that the workman\n",
      "laboring day after day on the same class, and often on the same kind\n",
      "of pieces, of work, is in a position to discern and to study out\n",
      "many minor improvements in tools and methods which are valuable. A\n",
      "kindly hearing accorded him, the adoption of such suggestions as are\n",
      "practical, with some substantial reward for his study, will encourage\n",
      "not only him but other workmen to study their work and endeavor to\n",

      "\n",
      "From the principles that have been advanced in connection with the\n",
      "subjects of Manufacturing and Shop Management, it will be readily\n",
      "seen that the work of the manufacturing plant of the present day is a\n",
      "very complex matter, and there must necessarily be very complete and\n",
      "carefully formulated plans and systems by which all its operations are\n",
      "regulated, and a somewhat elaborate plan of records by which these\n",
      "operations and their results are recorded and filed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In formulating the necessary plans for the methods and records of a\n",
      "manufacturing establishment, we must first determine the requirements\n",
      "of the work and decide definitely on what we wish to accomplish. In\n",
      "other words, the conditions must be first examined and analyzed, their\n",
      "various factors studied at their true value, and the requirements\n",
      "determined, so that a general plan of operations may be followed.\n",
      "\n",
      "These methods shall cover the following subjects:\n",
      "\n",
      "  1. The selection and employment of workmen.\n",
      "  2. The methods of keeping the time of all employees.\n",
      "  3. The manner of paying workmen.\n",
      "  4. The ordering of work into the shops.\n",
      "  5. The routine of passing work through the shops.\n",
      "  6. The method of drawing stock and materials.\n",
      "  7. The ways of keeping and issuing tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Importance of Records.= Each of these methods will become a part of\n",
      "the routine of the establishment, and the operations carried on under\n",
      "it will be proper matters for regular records made from day to day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such records are exceedingly valuable as current information, and, when\n",
      "properly filed, become quite as valuable for reference in the future as\n",
      "for use in current operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all improvements in the working routine of manufacturing operations,\n",
      "there should be previous records by which the present performances may\n",
      "be checked and compared. By this arrangement, it is comparatively easy\n",
      "to ascertain whether or not any improvement is being made, and in what\n",
      "direction it is being made. This knowledge will suggest further plans\n",
      "and betterments. Should the records prove that there are losses rather\n",
      "than gains being made, the warning is equally valuable, and we make\n",
      "haste to better results and greater efficiency in the work.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, whether the plans and methods in use are really successful, or\n",
      "quite the reverse, it is of the utmost importance that we should know\n",
      "by prompt and accurate records just what the results are, in order\n",
      "to keep in close touch with the progress of events, and that, when\n",
      "plans do not produce the favorable results expected and desired, the\n",
      "information may be promptly available, the warning be heard, and plans\n",
      "altered or amended until they bring about a successful routine in the\n",
      "manufacturing operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Selection and Employment of Workmen.= This is an important matter,\n",
      "since it costs money to introduce new men in any business, and\n",
      "requires from a day or two to several weeks for the new man to become\n",
      "sufficiently accustomed to his work and surroundings to be of the same\n",

      "appointed as an Employment Agent, and it is his duty to keep the office\n",
      "and the shops supplied with competent men engaged at reasonable wages.\n",
      "He must therefore keep in close and accurate touch with the labor\n",
      "market, for the same reasons that the purchasing agent must know the\n",
      "state of the market for material and supplies. He must know how and\n",
      "where to reach workmen of the different classes whenever he is called\n",
      "upon to furnish them.\n",
      "\n",
      "While ordinary laborers may nearly always be obtained from the daily\n",

      "When men are wanted for positions above the average skilled workmen,\n",
      "the best and most promising will be nearly always distributed among\n",
      "the present employees who are deserving of advancement. To promote one\n",
      "of them, rather than hire some man from outside the organization, is\n",
      "usually good business policy. The man and his abilities are generally\n",
      "well known, while a stranger is always an unknown quantity. The men,\n",
      "being acquainted with the man, will be pleased to see him get the\n",
      "deserved promotion; and it is always wise to consider the popularity of\n",
      "proposed orders affecting the working force. The man himself will feel\n",
      "his added responsibilities much more than an outside man will, and will\n",
      "generally work harder to succeed in his new position. Therefore it is\n",
      "always best to give the first chance to present employees who have been\n",
      "faithful to the responsibilities thus far placed upon them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be found that in most of the departments there are employees\n",
      "who from one reason or another are doing work quite below their real\n",
      "capacity, hoping that later on there may be better opportunities\n",
      "for the coveted position. The Employment Agent should know the men\n",
      "of the force, and their abilities, so as to take advantage of these\n",
      "conditions. A man may be needed by a foreman in one department who is\n",
      "not aware that in a neighboring department may be just the kind of man\n",
      "he wants. The Employment Agent should know where to find the man at\n",
      "once.\n",

      "help, and may request the Employment Agent to hire a certain number of\n",
      "men of certain qualifications and abilities. At the same time, there\n",
      "may be another department in which there are more men than can be used\n",
      "to advantage. An arrangement for the temporary or permanent transfer of\n",
      "some of these men will be a great help to both departments, and will\n",
      "have the added advantage of keeping good men permanently employed.\n",
      "\n",
      "If a workman feels that his employment is permanent, and that there\n",
      "are fair opportunities for advancement, this will be the surest way\n",
      "to hold him faithful and loyal to the interests of the establishment;\n",
      "and the conditions that bring about this condition of mind in him will\n",
      "also draw other good men who will be glad to be counted as among those\n",
      "faithful to a company which appreciates their services and which will\n",
      "look to their interests as they consider those of their employers.\n",
      "The result will be that these men will give their best services, and\n",
      "even be on the alert to further the interests of the employer who has\n",
      "favored them. Thus a strong working organization is built up, which\n",
      "becomes one of the best and most valuable assets of the company.\n",

      "=Time Keeping.= As cost of labor is usually greater than any other in\n",
      "the manufacturing plant, and frequently greater than all other factors\n",
      "in the cost of manufacturing, it is very important that the records\n",
      "pertaining to this expense be properly planned and accurately kept.\n",

      "Various methods have been adopted and used for this purpose. Some of\n",
      "the more prominent plans will be given. They are each adapted to some\n",
      "certain kind or class of work, and it will often be found that in\n",
      "practice still different forms must be devised in order to meet the\n",
      "existing conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are three methods of recording the time of employees--namely:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. By entering the time in a book or upon cards, by a Time-Keeper.\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. By entering the time upon cards by the workman himself.\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. By stamping the time upon cards by the workman in a time-recording\n",
      " clock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first of these methods is the oldest form, and has now to a great\n",
      "extent gone out of use.\n",
      "\n",
      "[Illustration: Fig. 9. Pattern Shop Time Card.]\n",
      "\n",
      "A large majority of the work of a manufacturing plant requires that the\n",
      "time worked by the employees shall be registered twice. That is, one\n",
      "entry shall be of the _day time_ (time paid for _by the day_), which\n",
      "necessitates the recording of the total number of hours worked each\n",
      "day; the second entry shall record the _job time_ (the time worked upon\n",
      "the different jobs during the day). This second entry is sometimes\n",

      "various jobs or orders in force in the shop, the _day time_, from which\n",
      "the pay-roll is made up, is usually recorded on a strip of paper in\n",
      "a time clock, the operation being performed by each employee as he\n",
      "passes into the shop morning and afternoon, and when leaving at noon\n",
      "and night. Passing to the clock, the workman swings a lever to his\n",
      "individual number, and presses in a knob, whereby the exact time of the\n",

      " may properly be made on account of advance payments that have been\n",
      " made upon due authority.\n",

      " may not be held back for an unreasonable length of time pending the\n",

      "construction of this general rule the castings should be furnished by\n",
      "the Foundry and sent to the Store-Room, from which they might be drawn\n",
      "upon requisitions the same as any other material. Practically this\n",
      "would be not only a troublesome but an expensive method, requiring a\n",
      "great deal of unnecessary handling and transportation. The problem\n",
      "is much more practically solved by considering the Foundry as one of\n",
      "the manufacturing departments receiving its raw material (namely, pig\n",
      "iron) through storeroom accounts, and thus \"constructively\" from the\n",
      "storeroom, while physically it is in the foundry yard. This answers the\n",
      "demands of a theoretical as well as a practical view of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore the first sub-production order will go to the iron foundry,\n",

      "\"clearing house\" for all departments in transacting inter-departmental\n",
      "business so far as it relates to the transfer of the work in progress.\n",

      "one of the men; and beneath the name two pins project about an inch\n",
      "from the face of the board. Under each pin is the man's individual\n",
      "number. Two forms of brass checks are used, a circular disc of 7/8 inch\n",
      "diameter, and a rectangular one 1/2 inch by 1 1/4 inches. Each check\n",
      "has a hole by which it may be hung on the pins, and each bears the\n",
      "individual number of the man, the checks being used in pairs of one\n",

      "\n",
      "The operation of this method is as follows: the circular checks (there\n",
      "are usually twelve of them) are issued to the men of corresponding\n",

      "the men's names. When a man goes to the Tool Room for a tool, or\n",
      "sends a boy for one, he presents one of his circular checks. This the\n",
      "Tool Keeper hangs on the right-hand pin under the man's name. He also\n",
      "removes one of the twelve rectangular checks, and hangs it on the pin\n",
      "in front of the space from which the tool was taken. If the workman\n",
      "sends for another tool, another circular check is added to the first\n",
      "one, and another rectangular check removed from the board.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be seen that there must always be twelve checks on the board\n",
      "under each name, counting both rectangular and circular ones. The\n",
      "absence of a tool from a shelf is accounted for by the rectangular\n",
      "check hung on the pin in place of it, and the number of this check\n",
      "shows what man has the tool. The number of circular checks on the board\n",
      "shows how many tools each man has in his possession.\n",

      "Until very recent years, engineers have rested satisfied with being\n",
      "designers of labor-saving appliances. Now, however, they are beginning\n",
      "to assume the broader and more profitable function of operating\n",
      "the plants which their brains have created. To handle the ordinary\n",
      "industrial enterprise successfully, involves:\n",
      "\n",
      " _First_, the application of engineering ability in selecting and\n",
      " improving the machines used;\n",
      "\n",
      " _Second_, managerial ability in organizing the workmen, and in\n",
      " stimulating them to produce a large output economically;\n",
      "\n",
      " _Third_, advertising ability to sell the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "The man who combines in himself the maximum sum of these three\n",
      "abilities is the man best adapted to succeed as the executive of an\n",
      "industrial enterprise. Since the introduction of systems of cost\n",
      "analysis and unit-payments for work done, engineers have become best\n",
      "qualified to act as managers of manufacturing plants. We include\n",
      "contracting and railroading among manufacturing industries, for the\n",
      "contractor manufactures structures, and the railroader manufactures\n",
      "transportation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before cost analysis had been developed to its present stage of\n",
      "excellence, the successful manager of men was usually one who had\n",
      "relied upon his lynx eyes and his knowledge of the weaknesses of human\n",
      "nature. He was often a man who owed his success largely to the fear he\n",
      "could inspire in his subordinates. He was domineering; he held his men\n",
      "to their tasks; he was, indeed, an industrial captain; and he used\n",
      "army discipline. He regarded every worker as a thief who would not\n",
      "hesitate at petty larceny of time, even in the face of the foreman, and\n",
      "who delighted in grand larceny behind his back. His foremen were his\n",
      "spies; and he set himself to spy upon his foremen. But cost-analysis\n",
      "engineering is evolving a wholly different class of managers and\n",
      "foremen.\n",
      "\n",
      "To most people, a cost-keeping system means nothing but a sort of\n",
      "bookkeeping; and they are unable to understand how a bookkeeper can\n",
      "develop into a successful manager. But the truth is that modern cost\n",
      "keeping involves cost analysis, and cost analysis involves a study\n",
      "and comparison of methods and machines, and such a study leads to\n",
      "improvements and to commercial success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost keeping, in the sense that we use the term, has for its main\n",
      "object the determination of the efficiency of men. A proper system of\n",
      "cost keeping tells you daily what each workman or each gang of workmen\n",
      "has accomplished. It is better than a foreman, for it cannot \"stand in\"\n",
      "with the men. It is better than a foreman, for it costs you less and it\n",
      "tells you more. A cost-keeping system tells you who are your good men,\n",
      "and who are your lazy men. It shows you whom to discharge, and whom to\n",
      "promote. It tells you whose wages are too high, and whose are not high\n",
      "enough. And, finally, it leads to that ideal condition of industrial\n",
      "organization known as _profit-sharing_. How often have we read in\n",
      "novels of Utopia, where all men share in the profits of all business;\n",
      "and how often have we smiled with incredulity at the prospect? Yet\n",
      "Utopia is right here in America, in spots; and it is a Utopia far more\n",
      "rational than that of the dreamers. There are many firms that pay\n",
      "their men on a unit-price or bonus system. This is profit-sharing, and\n",
      "it is a profit-sharing begotten by the use of cost-keeping systems;\n",
      "for, when a manager has learned by cost keeping that certain men or\n",
      "groups of men produce more than others, he soon perceives the advantage\n",
      "of stimulating them to further use of brain and muscle by paying\n",
      "them either a bonus for each unit produced in excess of a prescribed\n",
      "minimum, or a unit-price for each piece of work performed. The men\n",
      "invariably respond to this stimulus, and often in a remarkable degree.\n",
      "It is nothing unusual for a man to increase his output 50 per cent\n",
      "upon the introduction of a bonus system of payment; and there are\n",
      "many instances of increase amounting to 200 per cent. Each man then\n",
      "becomes a contractor, and works with the zeal of a contractor, for his\n",
      "earnings increase as his energy and ability increase. This is practical\n",
      "profit-sharing that any workman can understand. It is not something\n",
      "vague and intangible, like 5 per cent per annum. It is something very\n",
      "real and immediate, for a man can feel it in the pay envelope at the\n",
      "end of every week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cost keeping, then, leads to better management, although dispensing\n",
      "largely with submanagers. It substitutes the record card for the \"big\n",
      "stick,\" yet the record card itself is the biggest stick ever devised.\n",
      "\n",
      "=The Science of Management.= The managing of industrial enterprises is\n",
      "still more or less of an art; but the art is fast passing through the\n",
      "period of evolution that produces a science. There are, unquestionably,\n",
      "certain underlying principles of management which can be summarized\n",
      "into rules or laws. These rules or laws constitute the science of\n",
      "management, and it is our purpose to present certain of the more\n",
      "important laws of management.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Individual Incentive.= When a group of men undertake to do a certain\n",
      "piece of work, such as shoveling earth into a wagon, the tendency is\n",
      "for each man to do as little as his neighbor. The inevitable result\n",
      "is that the shovels move with rhythmic precision, and the slowest man\n",
      "becomes the pacemaker for the rest. If any one of the men is ambitious\n",
      "to do a larger day's work, he is deterred by the knowledge that his\n",
      "employer will never know that it is he to whom the credit is due for a\n",
      "larger output. Then, too, the other men are apt to upbraid an ambitious\n",
      "man, and urge him not to set a \"bad example\" by working fast. To offset\n",
      "this tendency to fall to the lowest level of efficiency, employers have\n",
      "placed foremen over their employees, the duty of these foremen being\n",
      "to accelerate the motions of the men in any way possible. Each foreman\n",
      "has an _individual incentive_ to get work done economically, for his\n",
      "employer studies the total amount of work done by the gang under the\n",
      "foreman, and rewards or punishes the foreman accordingly, the reward\n",
      "usually consisting of praise and an increase in salary. But the workmen\n",
      "under such a foreman have no _individual incentive_, and they will\n",
      "shirk their tasks as far as possible. Clearly, then, the first law of\n",
      "management is to create an _individual incentive_ for every employee to\n",
      "do his best.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Creating Individual Incentive in a Gang.= There are, and always will\n",
      "be, certain kinds of work that must be performed by a group of men\n",
      "working together, or, as we shall call it, a _gang_ of men. When\n",
      "this is the case, the first step to be taken is to devise a method of\n",
      "readily and accurately measuring the work performed _each day_--not\n",
      "each week or each month--by the gang. The next step is to notify the\n",
      "men that, for all work performed daily in excess of a specified number\n",
      "of units of work, a bonus or premium will be paid for each excess unit.\n",
      "Of this bonus, the foreman will get a specified percentage, and the\n",
      "men will divide the rest among themselves. Thus a powerful individual\n",
      "incentive is created. It is true that certain men in the gang will\n",
      "remain less efficient than certain others, but the general average\n",
      "output will be greatly increased. The foreman himself will have enough\n",
      "incentive to see to it that the lazy or inefficient workmen in the\n",
      "gang are discharged, for it will no longer pay him to play the part of\n",
      "indulgence for the sake of being \"a good fellow.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "=Devising Ways of Dispensing with Gang Work.= Simply because it has\n",
      "always been the custom to do certain classes of work by gangs, should\n",
      "not deter a manager from endeavoring to devise a way of splitting\n",
      "the gang up into individual units. Indeed, it should be self-evident\n",
      "that if the creating of individual incentive is the fundamental law\n",
      "of management, a great amount of study may profitably be devoted to\n",
      "increasing individual incentive by doing away with gang work entirely.\n",
      "To illustrate, let us assume that 12 men are engaged in shoveling\n",
      "earth into wagons, working in two gangs of 6 men, with one foreman\n",
      "supervising the 12. If a sufficient number of teams and wagons are\n",
      "used, there will always be 2 wagons in the pit being loaded, and 6 men\n",
      "shoveling into each wagon. As fast as a wagon is loaded, it pulls out,\n",
      "and an empty one takes its place. If a manager is told that he can do\n",
      "away with this system of gang work, he will usually reply that it is\n",
      "impossible. Nevertheless, it is possible to reduce this gang work to\n",
      "individual work in most instances, as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead of having 2 wagons and teams in the pit all the time, have 6\n",
      "wagons without teams--6 empty wagons. Assign two men to each wagon.\n",
      "Provide a dividing board between the sides of each wagon, running\n",
      "either longitudinally or cross-wise, so that each man has his definite\n",
      "half of the wagon to fill. Then pair the men off according to their\n",
      "respective abilities, putting the two best men on one wagon, the two\n",
      "next best on another wagon, and so on. When a team brings an empty\n",
      "wagon into the pit, let it be unhooked from the empty wagon and hooked\n",
      "to a loaded wagon, thus saving team time, which would otherwise be\n",
      "consumed in waiting for the wagon to be loaded.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible to give many illustrations of this sort, but not\n",
      "desirable, for our object is to indicate the laws that should\n",
      "be applied, rather than to solve specific problems. The student\n",
      "of cost-analysis engineering will derive his greatest stimulus\n",
      "from applying the laws to specific cases that come under his own\n",
      "observations.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Prompt Reward.= Most men believe in Heaven, and many believe in Hell;\n",
      "but few are greatly affected in their action by the hope of the one\n",
      "or the fear of the other. Any reward or punishment that is remote\n",
      "in the time of its application, has a relatively faint influence in\n",
      "determining the average man's conduct. To be most effective, the reward\n",
      "or punishment must follow swiftly upon the act. Hence a managerial\n",
      "policy that may be otherwise good is likely to fail if there is not a\n",
      "prompt reward for excellence. All profit-sharing systems have failed,\n",
      "principally because of failure to recognize the necessity of prompt\n",
      "reward, as well as because of failure to recognize the necessity of\n",
      "individual incentive. The lower the scale of intelligence, the more\n",
      "prompt should be the reward. A common laborer should receive at least\n",
      "a statement of what he has earned every day. If, in the morning, he\n",
      "receives a card stating that he earned $2.10 the previous day, he will\n",
      "go at his task with a vim, hoping to do better. But if he does not know\n",
      "what he has earned until the end of a week, his imagination is not apt\n",
      "to be vivid enough to spur him to do his best.\n",
      "\n",
      "One contractor, known to the authors, has a large blackboard on which\n",
      "the hourly record of his brickmasons is chalked up. He has found\n",
      "that this constant record of where they stand in the day's race is a\n",
      "splendid stimulus.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Sufficient Reward.= When a man produces more than has been his custom,\n",
      "he feels entitled to a very large percentage of his increased output.\n",
      "His sense of justice is keen on this matter, and rightly so. It is true\n",
      "that he is not entitled to all the increase, for his employer may have\n",
      "provided him with machines or tools of a better kind, for which payment\n",
      "must ultimately be made. Moreover, more rapid work with any machine\n",
      "means more rapid wearing-out of its parts, and a consequent expense to\n",
      "the employer. Finally, the employer who has used his brains to devise\n",
      "ways of increasing the output of the employees is entitled to a very\n",
      "substantial reward. No one begrudges Thomas Edison his wealth. He has\n",
      "earned it by virtue of his inventions. In like manner, every man should\n",
      "be richly rewarded for every labor-saving machine or method which he\n",
      "creates or which he applies. However, employers are prone to try to\n",
      "take too large a part of the profit effected by an introduction of a\n",
      "system of unit-payment for work done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Fred W. Taylor says that a workman should receive 30 to 100 per\n",
      "cent increase in wages upon the introduction of a piece-rate or\n",
      "bonus system of payment. Mr. Halsey says that the workman should\n",
      "receive one-third of increased value of his product resulting from an\n",
      "application of the bonus or premium system of payment. But the fact\n",
      "is that the employer should share liberally with his men; and, in the\n",
      "long run, the competition of other employers who are bidding for the\n",
      "services of workmen will force wages up to a point where the workman\n",
      "secures all but a very moderate percentage of the value of his daily\n",
      "product.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Educational Supervision.= As previously stated, the old type of\n",
      "foreman mingles the functions of a spy with the functions of a\n",
      "mule-driver. The higher we go in the scale of human intelligence,\n",
      "however, the more noticeable is the fact that _the supervisors are\n",
      "teachers of the men they supervise_. These supervisors, foremen,\n",
      "managers--call them what you may--have learned that it pays\n",
      "better to spend time in training their men than to spend time in\n",
      "tongue-thrashing. Only of late years has it been discovered that\n",
      "systematic training of the least intelligent of workmen pays equally\n",
      "as well as the training of the most intelligent. The manager who\n",
      "recognizes the necessity of educational supervision, undertakes,\n",
      "first, a careful time study of each class of work. Then he analyzes\n",
      "the results, and deduces methods of securing greater economy.\n",
      "Having evolved a method of procedure, he reduces it to writing, and\n",
      "furnishes his foremen with detailed written or printed instructions\n",
      "to be followed, or, where the workmen are intelligent enough, the\n",
      "instructions are given to them directly; otherwise it is the function\n",
      "of the foreman to instruct the workmen.\n",
      "\n",
      "=Divorce of Planning from Performance.= We have just spoken of the\n",
      "education of the workmen by the manager; but, before such education is\n",
      "possible, the manager must educate himself. In brief, he must study\n",
      "the problem and plan its most economic solution. According to the\n",
      "old-style method of management, each foreman was left largely to his\n",
      "own resources in planning methods, and, added to this duty, he had\n",
      "several other duties to perform, such as \"pounding the men on the back\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The object of this work is to help people who are out of employment to\n",
      "secure a situation; to enable persons of small means to engage in\n",
      "business and become their own employers; to give men and women in\n",
      "various lines of enterprise ideas whereby they may succeed; and to\n",
      "suggest new roads to fortune by the employment of capital. The author\n",
      "has been moved to the undertaking by the reflection that there exists\n",
      "nowhere a book of similar character. There have indeed been published a\n",
      "multitude of books which profess to tell men how to succeed, but they\n",
      "all consist of merely professional counsel expressed in general terms.\n",
      "We are told that the secrets of success are “industry and accuracy,”\n",
      "“the grasping of every opportunity,” “being wide awake,” “getting up\n",
      "early and sitting up late,” and other cheap sayings quite as well known\n",
      "to the taker as to the giver. Even men who have made their mark, when\n",
      "they come to treat of their career in writing, seem unable to give any\n",
      "concrete suggestions which will prove helpful to other struggling\n",
      "thousands, but simply tell us they won by “hard work,” or by “close\n",
      "attention to business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of this book has gone to work on a totally different plan. I\n",
      "have patiently collected the facts in the rise of men to wealth and\n",
      "power, have collated the instances and instruments of fortune, and from\n",
      "these have sifted out the real secrets of success. When as in a few\n",
      "cases, the worn-out proverbs and principles are quoted, these are\n",
      "immediately reinforced by individual examples of persons who attributed\n",
      "their advancement to the following of these rules; but, in general, the\n",
      "suggestions are new, and in very many cases plans and lines of work are\n",
      "proposed by the author which are entirely original, and so far as he\n",
      "knows, absolutely untried. Hence, the work becomes of incomparable value\n",
      "to business men who are constantly seeking new means to interest the\n",
      "public and to dispose of their goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the vast field of action treated of in this work lies beyond\n",
      "the experience of any one man, but the author has talked with business\n",
      "men in every walk in life and gleaned from them the essential facts in\n",
      "their career; in many instances these facts are not the things they have\n",
      "done, but the things they would do if they could begin again, thus\n",
      "giving the reader the benefit both of their success and failure. As a\n",
      "book offering opportunities to the ambitious; presenting openings to\n",
      "those seeking a wider scope for their faculties; affording stimulation\n",
      "to persons of sluggish blood; and giving away trade and business secrets\n",
      "never before divulged; the author feels confident that the little work\n",
      "stands unrivaled, and as such he modestly offers it to the public for\n",
      "its approval.\n",

      "Young men are often discouraged because the desirable places all seem to\n",
      "be filled. But remember there is always room for the right man. Says a\n",
      "New York millionaire: “I hold that any young man, possessing a good\n",
      "constitution and a fair degree of intelligence, may become rich.” Says\n",
      "another business man: “I have made a personal canvass of a dozen of the\n",
      "largest business houses in five different commercial and professional\n",
      "lines to see to what extent there exist openings for young men.” In only\n",
      "two of the houses approached were the heads of the firms satisfied the\n",
      "positions of trust in those houses were filled by capable men. And in\n",
      "each of these two houses I was told that “of course, if the right sort\n",
      "of a young man came along who could tell us something about our business\n",
      "we did not already know, we should not let him slip through our fingers.\n",
      "Positions can always be created. In four of the houses, positions had\n",
      "been open for six months or more, and the sharpest kind of a lookout\n",
      "kept for possible occupants. These positions commanded salaries all the\n",
      "way from $2,000 to $5,000 a year. In the publishing business, I know of\n",
      "no less than six positions actually yawning for the men to come and fill\n",
      "them--not clerical positions, but positions of executive authority.\n",
      "Young men are desired in these places because of their progressive ideas\n",
      "and capacity to endure work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another prominent man who interviewed the heads of several large firms\n",
      "writes in a recent periodical as follows: “It is not with these firms a\n",
      "question of salary; it is a question of securing the highest skill with\n",
      "the most perfect reliability. This being secured, almost any salary to\n",
      "be named will be cheerfully paid. A characteristic of the business world\n",
      "to-day is that its institutions, empires in themselves, have grown to be\n",
      "too large for the handling of ordinary men. These institutions are\n",
      "multiplying in excess of the number of men whose business skill is broad\n",
      "and large enough to direct and command them. Hence, the really\n",
      "commanding business brain is at an immense premium in the market. A\n",
      "salary of $50,000 a year as president of a railroad or manufacturing\n",
      "company at first sight seems exorbitant; but the payment of such a\n",
      "salary usually means pure business. The right or the wrong man at the\n",
      "head of a great business interest means the making or the unmaking of\n",
      "fortunes for the stockholders. Only a single glance at the industrial\n",
      "world is needed to show that here is room for the advent of genius of\n",
      "the first order. This world, seething like a caldron, is boiling to the\n",
      "brim with questions of the most vexing and menacing kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the men who reached the top of fortune’s ladder, and see under\n",
      "what discouraging circumstances they began. James Fisk, called the\n",
      "Prince of the Erie, rose to that position from a ragged newsboy.\n",
      "Stephen Girard began on nothing, and became the greatest millionaire of\n",
      "his time. Young men, would you scorn to row a boat for a living?\n",
      "Cornelius Vanderbilt plied a boat between Staten Island and New York.\n",
      "Would you tramp the country as a surveyor for a map? Jay Gould began in\n",
      "that way, and forty years later satisfied certain doubters of his\n",
      "financial standing by showing them certificates of stocks worth\n",
      "$80,000,000. Do you fear to have your hands calloused with ax or saw?\n",
      "John W. Mackay, who acquired a fortune of $20,000,000, started in life\n",
      "as a shipwright. Is it beneath your social station to handle butter and\n",
      "eggs? “Lucky” Baldwin, the multi-millionaire, kept a country store and\n",
      "made his first venture by taking his goods overland in a cart to Salt\n",
      "Lake City. Are your fingers too delicate for the broom handle? A. T.\n",
      "Stewart began his business career by sweeping out the store. Do you\n",
      "abhor vile odors? Peter Cooper made $6,000,000 in the glue business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tens of thousands are looking for a place. Most of them have had places,\n",
      "but could not keep them. If you follow all the rules below, having\n",
      "obtained a place, you will never need to seek one again. The place will\n",
      "seek you. Employers are in search of the qualities herein to be\n",
      "considered, and they are willing to pay liberally for them. They are\n",
      "qualities that come high everywhere. If you possess them, you can in a\n",
      "short time command your own price. But do not scorn to take the humblest\n",
      "place. Merit, like murder, will out. Be sure you have the winning cards\n",
      "and wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. THE SECRET OF WORK.--Men will employ you if you mean business. When\n",
      "you find men working, work with them. Lend a hand. Every employer would\n",
      "rather employ a busy man than an idle man. When he sees you working, he\n",
      "will watch you. If he likes you, he will make you an offer. A glazier,\n",
      "being refused work at a place where a church was being erected, put down\n",
      "his kit of tools, picked up the broken pieces of glass which the workmen\n",
      "had thrown away, and, laboring just as if he had been hired to work,\n",
      "fashioned the finest church window in the world, and became rich and\n",
      "famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NATURE’S FURROW.--Plow in nature’s furrow. In general, a man is\n",
      "fitted for the thing he likes. Do that which you can do best. What you\n",
      "want to do you are called to do, and what you are called to do you can\n",
      "do. Darwin says that the fittest survive because they have a slight\n",
      "advantage over those which do not survive. Your liking for an occupation\n",
      "is the advantage you have over those who do not like it. Follow the\n",
      "hint, whether it be to publish a paper or peg shoes. A leading merchant\n",
      "in New York found his calling through having loaned money to a friend.\n",
      "He had to take his friend’s store to secure his money, and thus learned\n",
      "his gift for merchandise. The man was A. T. Stewart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. GENERAL DETAILS.--The best general is General Details. In business\n",
      "life, no matter is small enough to be despised. To master an infinite\n",
      "number of small things is to prepare yourself to master great things.\n",
      "When your employers see that you have everything at your fingers’ ends,\n",
      "they will intrust you with larger interests, and greater responsibility\n",
      "means greater pay. John Jacob Astor knew the minutest point about every\n",
      "part of his great business. _That_ was the secret of his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. THE PRISMATIC BRAIN.--Be many-sided, but transparent. Tell your\n",
      "employer where you have failed. Do not try to cover up a fault. Be\n",
      "absolutely honest. You may get along for a time on “shady” lines, but\n",
      "such success is only gained at the expense of ultimate loss. It is\n",
      "absolutely essential that your employer should have the utmost\n",
      "confidence in your integrity. Try by every means to gain that\n",
      "confidence. Court examination. Invite inspection. Remember that his\n",
      "profound belief in you--belief in you when out of business hours as well\n",
      "as in--is your surest stepping-stone to promotion. Character is power.\n",
      "Your success depends as much upon what you are as upon what you know or\n",
      "do. Stephen Girard once trusted his drayman to buy a shipload of tea\n",
      "worth $200,000. He trusted him because he knew his man, and he gave the\n",
      "young man the profits of the transaction, which amounted to $50,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. THE BRIDLED TONGUE.--Do not cross your employer in any way. Never\n",
      "dispute with him. You may be sure that you are right, but do not say so.\n",
      "You need not be a Democrat or an Episcopalian because your employer is,\n",
      "but if you are wise you will avoid discussing with him questions of\n",
      "politics or religion. Courtesy pays. Ross Winans, of Philadelphia,\n",
      "secured a business that netted him $100,000 a year simply through his\n",
      "politeness to two Russian agents, to whom others in the same trade had\n",
      "accorded scant courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. STUDYING THE STAIR ABOVE.--Study, not stars, but stairs. Learn all\n",
      "about the position next above you. When you can point out new methods to\n",
      "your employer, advance new ideas, or suggest new channels of trade or\n",
      "lines of work, you are surely on the way to promotion. Only, be sure\n",
      "that your new ideas are practical. There is no more direct road to the\n",
      "confidence of your employer than for him to see that you understand any\n",
      "part of his affairs better than he does himself. Employ your spare\n",
      "moments in studying the business. While the other clerks are joking, do\n",
      "you be learning. While the students at the boarding-house in Andover\n",
      "were chaffing each other during the wait for breakfast, Joseph Cook\n",
      "would turn to a big dictionary in one corner of the room and look out a\n",
      "word. He climbed many stairs above them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. THE MISSING FACTOR.--Your employers are wrestling with a question.\n",
      "They are uncertain whether to invest or not. They are doubtful about the\n",
      "character or standing of some man with whom they are or may become\n",
      "heavily involved. It will be worth thousands to you if you can procure\n",
      "any scrap of information that will help to set them right. A young clerk\n",
      "who discovered an error in Bradstreet’s was soon admitted to partnership\n",
      "in his employer’s firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. THE MAGNIFYING GLASS.--Make the most of your present position. Wear\n",
      "magnifying glasses. Exalt the importance of every item. Let not the\n",
      "smallest thing be done in a slipshod way. If you are answering letters\n",
      "for the firm, answer them briefly but completely. Remember that brevity\n",
      "is not brusqueness. If you are waiting on customers, treat the small\n",
      "customer just as courteously as the large one. You may be sure that your\n",
      "employer knows the market value of politeness. In the Bon Marché in\n",
      "Paris, the employers determined that something must be done more than\n",
      "was done in other stores so that every visitor would remember the place\n",
      "with pleasure and come again. The result was the most exquisite\n",
      "politeness ever seen in a mercantile establishment, and it has developed\n",
      "the largest business of its kind in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. THE MICROSCOPIC EYE.--The microscope shows a hundred things the naked\n",
      "eye cannot see. Endeavor to see what others fail to see--new\n",
      "possibilities of sales, new means of profit, new methods of doing\n",
      "things. It was by steadily looking at a thing until he saw what was not\n",
      "apparent to the superficial view that Thomas Edison became the greatest\n",
      "electrician of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10. SCORING A POINT WHEN OFF DUTY.--Do something for your employer when\n",
      "you are out of the shop or store. You may be sure that he will\n",
      "appreciate it. It is a fallacy that he has no claim on you when off\n",
      "duty. Do not give him the idea that you have no interest in the business\n",
      "except to get your salary, and no time to spare him except what you are\n",
      "paid for. Do not watch the clock; do not filch a few moments at the\n",
      "beginning or end of the day’s work, and do not ask leave of absence\n",
      "except when absolutely necessary. Do overwork and unpaid-for work, and\n",
      "when you see a point in favor of your firm, fasten to it. Become\n",
      "essential to the place, and you will rise in the place. “I can’t spare\n",
      "you,” said the publisher of a New York magazine to his advertising agent\n",
      "when another publisher offered him an increase of $1,000. “Let’s\n",
      "see--you are getting $5,000 now; I’ll make it $7,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11. THE STUDY OF MEN.--This is the very key to success. The proper study\n",
      "of mankind is man. The greatest college on earth is the business world.\n",
      "The man who can sell the most goods is the one who knows the weaknesses\n",
      "of human nature, and how to avail himself of them. Your best diploma is\n",
      "a big bill of sale. Sell something to everybody--what the customer wants\n",
      "if you have it; if not, what he doesn’t want; but at any rate, sell him\n",
      "something. It is related of a Yankee book-peddler that he sold three\n",
      "copies of the same book to a family in one day--to the husband in the\n",
      "store, to the wife who was calling at a neighbor’s, and to the daughter\n",
      "at home. And not one of the family wanted the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "Following the above lines, and adding thereto good health and steady\n",
      "habits, you cannot fail to be promoted and to rise to the highest\n",
      "position of responsibility, if not even to actual partnership in the\n",
      "firm. These are the qualities that proprietors are yearning for--nay,\n",
      "actually groaning for, but which are hard to find in the average man.\n",
      "Employers are keeping the sharpest kind of a watch for the right man. It\n",
      "is stated on the best of authority that there are a thousand business\n",
      "firms in New York and vicinity each having one or more $5,000 positions\n",
      "awaiting the men who can fill them. If you have the right qualities or\n",
      "will acquire them, at least a thousand great firms want your services,\n",
      "and posts of responsibility with almost unlimited salary await your hand\n",
      "or brain.\n",

      "Many men fail because they undertake a business without considering\n",
      "whether there is room for it; others because they do not thoroughly\n",
      "establish themselves in the place, making no effort to get a\n",
      "constituency; and yet others because they do not keep the goods that are\n",
      "in demand, or do not renew the stock sufficiently quick, or do not\n",
      "present their goods in an attractive way. Such causes of success or\n",
      "failure as are in the line of this work will now be considered. Here are\n",
      "the rules of an old merchant which he would take for his guidance were\n",
      "he to start anew in business:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12. THE MINIMUM BASIS.--Enumerate the entire number of heads of families\n",
      "in the town, village, ward, or neighborhood where you purpose to begin\n",
      "business. Figure out the number of such persons you will require as a\n",
      "minimum basis in order to get on--that is, how many persons or families,\n",
      "spending each on an average a certain amount per day or week at your\n",
      "place of business, you will require in order to make a living. Do not go\n",
      "blindly into your work, trusting to luck. Luck is always on the side of\n",
      "pluck and tact. Determine what per cent. of the people’s patronage is\n",
      "absolutely essential to your success. The first step is to ascertain if\n",
      "such per cent. is likely to come to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13. THE HOUSE TO HOUSE CANVASS.--Make a personal canvass from house to\n",
      "house. Do not trust the work to your friend, relative, or clerk. Nobody\n",
      "can help you so much as you can help yourself. Nobody has your interests\n",
      "so much at heart as you have. Tell people pleasantly that you are a new\n",
      "bidder for their patronage. Inform them what you propose to do. Make\n",
      "them to understand that no man shall undersell you, or give them in any\n",
      "way a better bargain. If possible, take a few samples of your choicest\n",
      "goods with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14. THE CHOICE LOCATION.--If you become popular, the people will come to\n",
      "you; but at first you must go to them. Your place need not be central or\n",
      "on a corner, but it must be where many people pass. Step out largely and\n",
      "conspicuously. You could make no greater mistake than to rent a shabby\n",
      "place on a back street. Have out all manner of signs, curious, newsy,\n",
      "and alluring. Do not think to sustain yourself by people’s sympathies.\n",
      "Men will trade most where they can do best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15. THE MAXIMUM BASIS.--The maximum basis is the high-water mark. It is\n",
      "the number of persons or families that under the most favorable state of\n",
      "things can be your patrons. All you cannot expect. Kindred, religion,\n",
      "politics, friendships, and secret fraternities, will hold a portion of\n",
      "the community to the old traders. The sharpest rivalry will meet you.\n",
      "Also, you must consider what incursions are likely to be made by\n",
      "out-of-town dealers, and what prospect there is of others setting up\n",
      "business in the place. But you should have an ideal trade toward which\n",
      "you steadily work. Declare daily to yourself, “my gross earnings shall\n",
      "be $--per day,” or “---- (so many) persons shall be my patrons.” When\n",
      "you fall below the mark, bestir yourself in many ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16. THE PERSONAL EQUATION.--Remember that you yourself in contact with\n",
      "your customers count for more than anything else. The weather of the\n",
      "face, the temperature of the hand, the color of the voice, will win\n",
      "customers where other means fail. Make your patrons feel that you are\n",
      "their friend. Inquire about members of their family. Be exceedingly\n",
      "polite. Recommend your goods. Mention anything of an especially\n",
      "attractive or meritorious nature you may have. Join the church, the\n",
      "regiment, the fire company, and the secret society. Become “all things\n",
      "to all men, if by any means you can sell to some.” Be everywhere in your\n",
      "place of business. Oversee the smallest details. Trust as little as\n",
      "possible to your clerks. The diamond of success is the master’s eye.\n",
      "Remember there is no fate. There are opportunity, purpose, grit, push,\n",
      "pluck, but no fate. If you fail, do not lay the blame upon\n",
      "circumstances, but upon yourself. Enthusiasm moves stones. You must\n",
      "carry your business in your brain. “A bank never gets to be very\n",
      "successful,” says a noted financier, “until it gets a president who\n",
      "takes it to bed with him.” There was an angel in Michael Angelo’s muddy\n",
      "stone, and there is a fortune in your humdrum store. Hard work and close\n",
      "thought are the hands that carve it out.\n",

      "succeeded by another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17. THE INTERLINED ADVERTISEMENT.--Advertisements are not read unless\n",
      "persons are looking for something in that line. This is because they are\n",
      "all placed by themselves. Your bid for patronage must be put in the\n",
      "midst of the reading matter if it is to attract general attention. Many\n",
      "publishers will not do this, but your chief and only point in appearing\n",
      "in the paper is to have your advertisement read, and it pays better to\n",
      "insert it in a journal with 5,000 readers who will all see it than in\n",
      "one having 100,000 subscribers, hardly 100 of whom will glance at the\n",
      "advertisement. You can afford to pay handsomely if the publisher will\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18. THE PICTURESQUE NAME.--Have a name for your store such as will\n",
      "easily fit everybody’s mouth. “The Beehive,” “The Blizzard,” “The\n",
      "Buttercup,” or “The Bonanza,” are suggestive titles. Many customers are\n",

      "tell a friend that you bought an article at “The Hub,” or “The Sun,”\n",
      "than to attempt the unpronounceable name of a proprietor, or to give a\n",
      "forgotten number. Successful men in several lines of business assert\n",
      "that they owe much of their good fortune to the happy hit of a popular\n",
      "name.\n",

      "19. THE PICTORIAL WRECK.--A writer with the gift of a lively imagination\n",
      "can write something interesting in the way of a fanciful battle between\n",
      "customers and goods. Head lines, “Great Slaughter in ---- (the taking\n",
      "name of your store),” “Wreck of Old Conservatism,” “Smash of High\n",
      "Prices,” “Ruined by the Rush.” Then would follow a graphic description\n",
      "of the charge of customers upon wares in which the store was almost\n",
      "wrecked by the enormous number of people who took advantage of the\n",
      "under-cost prices. People enjoy this kind of pleasantry, and the impulse\n",
      "to follow the crowd is almost irresistible. A certain New York house\n",
      "grew from a small to a great one by this method of advertising.\n",

      "20. RED LETTER DAY.--Have a day in which you offer special bargains to\n",
      "the people of a certain town, village or hamlet. Put up flaming posters,\n",
      "announcing “Squashville day,” “Jonesboro Day,” “Bloomington day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21. CLASS DISCOUNT.--You may draw numbers of men to your place by this\n",
      "means. Secret fraternities, workingmen’s orders, church societies,\n",
      "wheelmen’s leagues, will be attracted to you if they know you specially\n",
      "favor them. Fortunes have been made by close attention to these great\n",
      "organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22. THE HONEST FLAW.--Strictly instruct your clerks to tell your\n",
      "customers the precise nature of every article; if the quality is\n",
      "inferior, make them to understand exactly what they are getting for\n",
      "their money; and if there be a flaw, let them be careful to point it\n",
      "out. By such means thousands of people who cannot trust their own\n",
      "judgment in these matters, will be attracted to a place where they are\n",
      "certain to be treated fairly. A. T. Stewart, who began business in a\n",
      "modest store, and who, in the latter part of his life sold $20,000,000\n",
      "worth of goods every year, declared that this plan was the keynote of\n",
      "his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23. THE PREMIUM CLERK.--You need clerks who can induce acquaintances to\n",
      "visit your store, cajole visitors into customers, and coax customers to\n",
      "become larger buyers. If you have a number of clerks and your business\n",
      "will admit of it, offer a monthly premium to the one who brings into the\n",
      "store the largest number of new buyers or into the cash-drawer the\n",
      "heaviest receipts. There are certain kinds of business where this plan\n",
      "will work, and will be provocative of such competition as greatly to\n",
      "increase trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "24. THE RAILROAD MILEAGE.--Arrange, if possible, with some railroad\n",
      "company to issue mileage tickets as premiums to those who will trade\n",
      "with you. At two cents a mile you could afford to give two miles of\n",
      "travel for every one dollar’s worth of goods. At that rate $500 worth of\n",
      "goods would buy a $20 mileage ticket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25. THE DIAL DOLLARS.--How many figures on the dial of your watch?\n",
      "Twenty-eight, counting the number VI, which is generally either omitted\n",
      "or only partly indicated. Fix a big dial two feet or more in diameter in\n",
      "some prominent part of your store, and announce that when a customer has\n",
      "traded an amount equal to the total figures on the dial you will present\n",
      "him with a watch. Of course, the timepiece would be a very cheap one,\n",
      "but many a parent will trade with you for the sake of getting a watch\n",
      "for his child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26. FIRST CUSTOMER PACKAGE.--In some periods of the day you will have\n",
      "more custom than you can well attend to, while at other times you will\n",
      "have nothing to do. The following plan will perhaps help to equalize\n",
      "trade, and also give you additional buyers: Suspend a package in some\n",
      "conspicuous part of your store with the announcement thereon that it\n",
      "will be given free to the first customer in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27. THE CARPET COUPON.--By a system of large-sized coupons--we will say\n",
      "a foot square--you can put into practice a unique system that will\n",
      "appeal to the heart of every housewife. Publish that you will give a\n",
      "free carpet of a certain size and grade when a fixed amount has been\n",
      "traded. A square foot of a coupon represents a sum of money spent in the\n",
      "store--perhaps one dollar. Every woman by measuring her room can learn\n",
      "how many dollars’ worth of goods she must buy before she can have a free\n",
      "carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "28. THE HOUSE LOT COUPON.--This is an extension of carpet coupon. A\n",
      "certain amount of purchased goods entitles one to a building lot, which,\n",
      "if in the country, need not be of great cost. Have the particular lots\n",
      "selected and advertised. Another plan is to offer the lot to the largest\n",
      "purchaser within a certain time--possibly five years. This is a good way\n",
      "to hold on to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29. PRICE-TIME GRADE.--If you have the credit system, have also a\n",
      "gradation of prices so as to encourage people to pay at the earliest\n",
      "possible time. A system like this would do--forty days full price;\n",
      "thirty days, two per cent. off; twenty days, three per cent. off; ten\n",
      "days, four per cent. off; cash, five per cent. off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30. SALES BULLETIN.--People like to buy where others buy. Success brings\n",
      "success. If you are doing well, you may do better. Have a large bulletin\n",
      "board in front of your store, or near it, announcing your sales for the\n",
      "past week. Newspapers boom themselves in like manner by publishing their\n",
      "enormous circulation.\n",

      "reason for trading at Push & Pluck’s, and then insert in the form of an\n",
      "advertisement in a leading paper a list of the best reasons. Six months\n",

      "before that holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "32. BIRTHDAY CALENDAR.--A calendar with the birthdays of your customers\n",
      "(age of course omitted), would attract attention, and the offer to give\n",
      "a present to any one trading a certain amount before his birthday would\n",
      "certainly add to your receipts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33. CONSPICUOUS PRICE-LIST.--Buyers are caught like fish. Display in\n",
      "your window a list of cut prices. Passers-by who cannot resist the\n",
      "opportunity of a bargain will come in, and often be induced to purchase\n",
      "the goods which are not reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34. THE EARLY DISCOUNT.--In order to equalize the trade of the day\n",
      "announce that you will give a slight discount to persons trading during\n",
      "the dull hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35. THE MONEY-SPACE COUNTER.--Determine that every portion of your store\n",
      "shall pay. Have every lineal foot of your counters calculated at a\n",
      "certain rate of profit. If you find a department that does not pay,\n",
      "change methods or your goods, and if still unsuccessful drop it. Many\n",
      "large dealers fail because they keep departments where the expenses are\n",
      "more than the profits. But if every foot of room pays only a little, the\n",
      "entire store must pay handsomely.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be seen in the foregoing how every leading impulse in human\n",
      "nature is appealed to--curiosity and cupidity, honesty and economy,\n",
      "personal flattery and local pride. If, in addition to these powerful\n",
      "inducements to patronage, you combine shrewdness in buying and\n",
      "cautiousness in trusting, if your goods are excellent in quality and\n",
      "generous in quantity, if your place of business is neat and attractive,\n",
      "and your service marked by promptness and politeness; then it is\n",

      "new departures in dry and fancy goods, are all anxious to have the\n",
      "public take their products and pay them in cash. The problem is how to\n",
      "introduce the article. However meritorious it may be, it is useless\n",
      "unless the people find it out. The following are believed to be unique\n",
      "methods of advertising:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36. THE PUZZLE.--Buy some patented puzzle which can be manufactured\n",
      "cheap and scattered broadcast over the land. There is no better way to\n",
      "advertise. If men do not solve the puzzle, they will remember what is\n",
      "stamped on it. The “Get-off-the-earth-Chinese puzzle” enormously\n",
      "advertised its purchasers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37. THE TOY IMITATION.--Wooden nutmegs and shoe-peg oats have duly\n",
      "advertised the shrewd ways of the people of Connecticut. A man recently\n",
      "made a hit by the “imitation cigar,” which is only a piece of wood of\n",
      "the shape and color of a cigar. Every boy wants one. As an advertising\n",
      "medium it was an immense success. Think of something as common and cheap\n",
      "as a cigar, get up an imitation for the children, have your enterprise\n",
      "stamped upon it, and it will go from one end of the land to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38. THE CARTOON.--A caricature of some political person or situation is\n",
      "always taking. Hit off some social craze, or give a witty representation\n",
      "of some matter of passing interest. Drops of ink in this way are seeds\n",
      "of gold, and the harvest will be golden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39. THE CONJURER.--This is a good way to advertise when the article is a\n",
      "cheap affair which can be shown in the street. There are few things so\n",
      "attractive to the masses as the tricks of the sleight-of-hand performer.\n",
      "Mr. P. T. Barnum uttered at least an half-truth when he said the people\n",
      "liked to be humbugged. For a few dollars you can get an equipment, and\n",
      "in a few days’ practice you can acquire enough of the art for your\n",
      "purpose. You can draw a crowd wherever there are people. When you have\n",
      "performed a few tricks, your climax should be a shrewd advertisement\n",
      "which can be worked into the last performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "40. THE STRIKING FIGURE.--If your goods are on sale in some prominent\n",
      "store, this device is sure to draw attention. Make a figure of some\n",
      "animal or vegetable or other form, if your article will lend itself to\n",
      "such a work. The figure could be some prominent man, or represent an\n",
      "historic scene, or illustrate some popular movement. A dealer in\n",
      "confectionery had in his window a bicycle made all of candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41. THE ADVERTISING STORY.--Offer a prize to the one who will write the\n",
      "best story about the merits of your article. The latter must be brought\n",
      "deftly into the story, and the award should be based upon the merits of\n",
      "the literary production and the skill in the use of the advertisement.\n",
      "Every competitor should be required to buy a small number of the\n",
      "articles, and the story should be published.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42. THE WORD-BUILDER.--Another prize might be offered to the one who\n",
      "could compose the greatest number of words from the name of your article\n",
      "or invention. The name ought to include at least a dozen letters, and\n",
      "there should be a set of rules for building words. Every contestant must\n",
      "buy your invention from whose title he is to build words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43. THE POPULAR PUN.--This is an expensive way of advertising, but an\n",
      "immensely paying one. You make a pun upon some fad of the day, a hit\n",
      "upon some general craze, a piercing of some passing bubble, a political\n",
      "quib. Something of this nature printed several times in the issue of the\n",
      "daily papers would make your venture known to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "44. THE POLITICAL GUESSER.--If your enterprise admits of the coupon\n",
      "system, offer a prize to the one who will guess the successful candidate\n",
      "at the next election, and come the nearest to the figures of his\n",
      "plurality. The contestant must purchase one of your articles, and in\n",
      "this way hundreds of thousands may be sold. Every presidential election\n",
      "is the occasion of the floating of many things by this scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45. THE GEOMETRICAL GROUP.--Some wares, such as fancy soaps and canned\n",
      "goods, admit of a grouping which is very attractive to the eye.\n",
      "Pyramids, cones, circles, and towers, always draw attention. Some\n",
      "mechanical device whereby motion is produced will be sure to draw a\n",
      "crowd to your show window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46. THE PICTORIAL COMPARISON.--If you are sure of your ground, draw a\n",
      "diagram or other figure, comparing your staple with those of others in\n",
      "the market. In this way the Royal Baking Powder Company pushed to the\n",
      "front, comparing with heavy black lines its product with the outputs of\n",
      "other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "47. THE OPEN CHALLENGE.--And if you are still further confident that you\n",
      "have the best thing of its kind, you may issue a challenge to your\n",
      "competitors. Make it apparent that you are anxious, even clamorous, for\n",
      "a trial of your product against others. By this means you will establish\n",
      "yourself in the confidence of the public. The Remington Typewriter was\n",
      "boomed in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48. THE BOOK GIFT.--Try the religious field. Issue leaflets or tiny\n",
      "books with paper covers, costing not more than two or three dollars a\n",
      "thousand, and offer them as gifts to Sunday-schools or other children’s\n",
      "organization. Most Sunday-school superintendents would be glad to give\n",
      "away booklets of this kind if they could be obtained free of charge. The\n",

      "taking presentation of your wares.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "49. SUNDAY-SCHOOL SUPPLIES.--In some cases, you might even be warranted\n",
      "in issuing the supplies of a Sunday school, at least for a portion of\n",
      "the year. The books in the last number might not in every case be read,\n",
      "but the picture papers, lesson leaves, and other helps, are all looked\n",
      "over, even if not studied. You could in many cases present them,\n",
      "reserving large advertising space for yourself so as to net a good\n",
      "profit. The class of customers thus obtained would be the very best. Do\n",
      "not hope for large returns unless you are willing to spend money. Money\n",
      "is the manure that creates crops, the blood that makes fatness, the wind\n",
      "that fans fortune, the sap that runs into golden fruit. Money is the\n",
      "bread on the waters that “returneth after many days.” It seems like the\n",
      "sheerest folly to spend so much in advertising, but you cannot reap\n",
      "bountifully unless you sow bountifully. “For every dollar spent in\n",
      "advertising,” declares a successful merchant, “I have reaped five.”\n",

      "the goods, and the man who keeps the goods in large stock, and all this\n",

      "veritable store. An expenditure of $25 should give you a show window and\n",

      "your sales at first are small, you can put in your spare time in the\n",
      "making of your goods, and afterward as your custom increases you can\n",

      "A home may be rendered attractive by a few simple ornaments that are\n",
      "very cheap. Vines, grasses, etc., add touches of beauty to a home and\n",
      "cost very little. Few people know how to prepare these little\n",
      "curiosities, and many would esteem it too much trouble to get and\n",
      "arrange the material if they did know. But most of these persons would\n",
      "buy them if the materials were prepared, and the vines, etc., ready to\n",
      "grow. You must have models of each kind in full growth in order to\n",
      "excite their admiration, and then you must have others in the initial\n",
      "stage for sale. Take pains to show the models, and explain the method of\n",
      "treating the plants and vines. The following cost little, and can be\n",
      "sold for from 300 to 500 per cent. profit. Some of your patrons will\n",
      "prefer to buy the models outright, and others to grow them themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "50. CRYSTALLIZED GRASSES.--Put in water as much alum as can be\n",
      "dissolved. Pour into an earthen jar and boil slowly until evaporated\n",
      "nearly one half. Suspend the grasses in such a manner that their tops\n",
      "will be under the solution. Put the whole in a cool place where not the\n",
      "least draught of air will disturb the formation of crystals. In\n",
      "twenty-four to thirty-six hours take out the grasses, and let them\n",
      "harden in a cool room. For blue crystals, prepare blue vitriol or\n",
      "sulphate of copper in the same manner. Gold crystals can be produced by\n",
      "adding tumeric to the alum solution, and purple crystals by a few drops\n",
      "of extract of logwood. Sell them at twenty-five cents a bunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "51. LEAF IMPRESSIONS.--Hold oiled paper in the smoke of a lamp, or of\n",
      "pitch, until it becomes coated with smoke. Then take a perfect leaf,\n",
      "having a pretty outline, and after warming it between the hands, lay\n",
      "the leaf upon the smoked side of the paper, with the under side down,\n",
      "press it evenly upon the paper so that every part may come in contact,\n",
      "go over it lightly with a rolling-pin, then remove the leaf with care to\n",
      "a piece of white paper, and use the rolling-pin again. You will then\n",

      "leaf. A sheet containing a dozen such leaves should bring you\n",
      "twenty-five cents; if arranged in a pretty white album, with a different\n",

      "one dollar.\n",

      "52. VINE AND TRELLIS.--Put a sweet potato in a tumbler of water, or any\n",
      "similar glass vessel; let the lower end of the tuber be about two inches\n",
      "from the bottom of the vessel; keep on the mantel shelf, and sun it for\n",
      "an hour or two each day. Soon the “eyes” of the potato will throw up a\n",
      "pretty vine. Now with some small sticks or coarse splints construct a\n",
      "tiny trellis, which, if placed in the window, will soon find a customer.\n",
      "\n",

      "half an inch of the surface of some water contained in a vase, tumbler\n",
      "or saucer, and allow it to remain undisturbed for several weeks. It will\n",

      "the leaves about ten minutes, or until they are whitened. Remove them on\n",
      "a piece of paper and wash them in clean water. They are now ready for\n",
      "sale, and all you need do is to arrange a dozen of them on a sheet of\n",

      "the leaves, and with starch on the other to give the velvety appearance\n",
      "of the under side. Use a fine goffering tool to make the veins and\n",

      "better and cheaper article than they can get elsewhere. You will find\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "134. HOT GEMS.--If you can work up a demand for hot gems, you can make a\n",
      "good profit. Take a pint each of flour and milk, an egg, and half a\n",
      "teaspoonful of salt. Beat the egg until light, add the milk and salt to\n",
      "it, and beat gradually into the flour. Bake twenty minutes in hot\n",
      "gem-pans. The quantities given will make a dozen gems. Notice should be\n",
      "given of the hour of the day when they may be expected to be fresh from\n",
      "the oven. Charge twenty-five cents a dozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "135. SLICED WATERMELON.--Nothing so delights the heart of a boy. Cut a\n",
      "large ripe melon into half-slices, rather thick, and lay them on ice in\n",
      "the show window. Cost of melon and ice, fifty cents. Twenty slices at\n",
      "five cents each, $1. Profit, one-half.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "136. TOOTHSOME PIES.--Roll two strips of paste for the upper and lower\n",
      "crusts. Place the latter in position after moistening the plate, and\n",
      "fill with the prepared material already sweetened and seasoned. Lay on\n",
      "the upper crust, and make a little slit in the center. Put in hot oven,\n",
      "close draft after fifteen minutes, and bake from fifty minutes to one\n",
      "hour. Charge twenty-five cents for good deep pies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "137. ICE CREAM.--You can do well with this in warm weather, if you have\n",
      "a room suitable for serving. One pint of sugar, one of water, and three\n",
      "of cream, the yolks of five eggs and a large tablespoonful of the\n",
      "flavoring extract. Boil the sugar and water twenty-five minutes. Beat\n",
      "the eggs with one fourth of a teaspoonful of salt. Place the basin of\n",
      "boiling syrup in another of boiling water, and, stirring the yolks of\n",
      "the eggs into the syrup, beat rapidly for three minutes. Take the basin\n",
      "from the fire, place it in a pan of ice water, and beat until cold. Add\n",
      "the cream and extract, and, placing the mixture in the freezer, pack\n",

      "until the cream is frozen hard.\n",

      "\n",
      "138. PORK AND BEANS.--You can make a large profit on pork and beans in\n",
      "places where there is a demand for them. Both are cheap, and you can\n",
      "make a handsome profit on a dish selling for thirty-five cents, the dish\n",
      "to be returned. It is well if you can to make a bargain to supply\n",
      "families once a week on particular days. This dish takes well in all\n",
      "parts of New England.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "139. TOMATO KETCHUP.--Raising your own tomatoes, you can make it at a\n",
      "trifling cost, and reap a profit at ten cents for small bottles. For\n",
      "twelve ripe, peeled tomatoes, take two large onions, four green peppers,\n",
      "and chop fine. Add two tablespoonfuls of salt, two of brown sugar, two\n",
      "of ginger, one of cinnamon, one of mustard, a nutmeg, grated; and four\n",
      "cupfuls of vinegar. Boil all together for three hours, stirring\n",
      "frequently, and bottle while hot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "140. MINCE MEAT.--Many housekeepers prefer to buy the preparation rather\n",
      "than to be at the trouble of making it. Lean beef, two pounds; beef\n",
      "suet, one pound; apples, five pounds; seeded raisins, two pounds;\n",
      "currants, two pounds; citron, three-fourths of a pound; pounded mace and\n",
      "pounded cinnamon, two tablespoonfuls each; one of grated nutmeg; one\n",
      "each of cloves and allspice; brown sugar two and one-half pounds; sherry\n",
      "wine, one quart; brandy, one pint. Put up in three-pound cans. The\n",
      "compound should make six cans, and you should charge seventy-five cents\n",
      "a can for so choice a product. You can reduce the expense, if your\n",
      "customers wish a cheaper article.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "141. DRIED APPLES.--If you have a few apple trees, you will often find\n",
      "it more profitable to dry for future sale than to sell the green fruit.\n",
      "Pare, core, and slice. Lay the slices in shallow pans or on clean\n",
      "boards, and expose to the air until thoroughly dried. Then pack and\n",
      "store for the winter market. You should get at least ten cents a pound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "142. PEANUTS.--No risk of loss on these for they will always sell. Buy\n",
      "from a shipper or wholesale grocer a bag of peanuts and roast them in\n",
      "the oven until they are a fine brown, taking care not to burn. Profits\n",
      "in a bag of peanuts selling at five cents, one-half pint, 100 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "143. CIGARETTES.--Roll a pinch of tobacco in a piece of white paper and\n",
      "scent with any agreeable perfume. More profit than in cigars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "144. TALLOW CANDLES.--Still used in the country, and to some extent by\n",
      "poor people in the city. Take beef and mutton suet in the proportion of\n",
      "one to two. Melt, and fill tin molds in which the wick has been\n",
      "previously inserted. The cost is little beyond the work. Charge\n",
      "twenty-five cents per dozen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "145. LUNG PRESERVER.--(Rock and Rye). Here is the secret of this popular\n",
      "remedy for coughs, colds and lung troubles. Rye whisky, three gallons;\n",
      "syrup, made of rock candy, one gallon. Cost of whiskey and syrup, $3.50.\n",
      "Put up in pint bottles at fifty cents each, $16. Profits, $12.50, or\n",
      "nearly 300 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "146. POISON KILLER.--You may not sell much of this, but it is a useful\n",
      "article to have in the house, and will keep indefinitely. Buy a\n",
      "quantity of powder of aristol, and put it in small pepper-boxes, or in\n",
      "any box with a perforated lid, holding a few ounces. Dust the affected\n",
      "part freely with this, and the effect on the poisoned flesh will be\n",
      "magical. Use for any inflammation. Advertise it in placards.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "147. MUCILAGE.--Dissolve gum-arabic in water until the whole is of the\n",
      "consistency of cream, and keep it from contact with the air. Add a few\n",
      "drops of sweet oil to prevent it from souring. The cost is almost\n",
      "nothing. You can sell it at five cents a bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "148. POP CORN.--Use a large popper, and when the corn comes out white\n",
      "and hot, add a little molasses to make it adhere, and flavor with some\n",
      "popular extract. Mold it in balls, rectangles, or in any other fancy\n",
      "shape. A bushel of shelled corn which costs a dollar will make 125\n",
      "balls. These at five cents apiece come to $6.25.\n",
      "\n",
      "This completes the list of one hundred articles for your store. Observe\n",
      "that they are all made at home, and for that reason the profits are from\n",
      "50 to 500 per cent., while in the ordinary way of buying from the\n",
      "wholesaler the storekeeper has to be satisfied with from 10 to 20 per\n",
      "cent. You will discover for yourself many other articles which can be\n",
      "made at home and sold at a profit, and you will not confine yourself to\n",
      "homemade goods, but will handle anything for which there is a demand\n",
      "whether you can make it yourself or not. Of course, if you make all the\n",
      "above goods, you will need much help, the cost of which will diminish\n",
      "somewhat the profits, but the design is that you begin on a modest\n",
      "scale, at first doing all the manufacturing yourself, and call in\n",
      "assistance as your business and capital grow. In writing this chapter\n",
      "the author has contemplated a lady as keeping a store of this kind, but\n",
      "a gentleman can do much of the work as well, and some sections of it\n",
      "better. Perhaps the ideal store would be that kept by husband and wife\n",
      "with growing children to assist. Now let us have the experience of a\n",
      "lady who has tried our plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. J---- G---- says: “By the death of my husband I was left alone with\n",
      "three children, Wilhelm fifteen, Gertrude thirteen, and Egbert ten. I\n",
      "had no means, though, fortunately, my little place in the suburban town\n",
      "of T---- was free of debt. It consisted of a neat house and three acres\n",
      "of land. Having a fondness for plants, I cultivated them in curious\n",
      "ways, while keeping my little family together by taking in sewing. One\n",
      "day a lady who was spending the summer in T---- called and inquired what\n",
      "I would take for a pea vine which was growing in a tumbler of water. I\n",
      "was surprised, as I had not thought of making merchandise of my plant\n",
      "pets. She purchased a number of pretty little odd things of vegetable\n",
      "life with which I had amused myself, and suggested that I might earn\n",
      "something by cultivating rare forms of plants. It was a new idea to me.\n",
      "I had not thought there was any money in what had been to me only a\n",
      "pastime, but I increased the number of my plant curiosities, and the\n",
      "lady and her friends bought them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then my friend said to me, ‘Why don’t you keep a Home Store? You have\n",
      "so much taste I think you would do nicely?’ ‘And pray what is a Home\n",
      "Store?’ I inquired. ‘Oh, it’s a store where the things are all made at\n",
      "home.’ ‘But I have no capital.’ ‘You need no capital. See, the things\n",
      "are all made at home. Begin with a few tea dishes.’ So I bought a ham,\n",
      "sliced it thin, and laid some sprigs of parsley around it. I also made\n",
      "some artificial honey from a recipe in an old cook book. With the money\n",
      "I thus earned, I had my window enlarged into a show-window, and put in\n",
      "a variety of vegetables from my garden, taking care they should be\n",
      "strictly fresh every day. I had such success that, at the suggestion of\n",
      "my lady patron, I began to make a great many other things--pastry,\n",
      "preserves, sweetmeats, and toilet articles. I also purchased one hundred\n",
      "fowls, and served my customers with fresh eggs. My trade grew so that I\n",
      "decided to have a real store, and so, at an expense of about $50, I had\n",
      "my two front rooms made into one and fitted up with shelves and\n",
      "counters. I purchased a cow and a pig on credit, and also two or three\n",
      "hives of bees. The people seemed to appreciate my fresh eggs, milk,\n",
      "butter and honey, and I soon paid all my debts and branched out in\n",
      "several other directions in the way of homemade goods. Hitherto, my\n",
      "three children had afforded me all the help I needed, but now I found it\n",
      "necessary to employ a cheap male laborer to look after my garden,\n",
      "orchard, cow, pig, and poultry, as well as to assist in making some of\n",
      "my goods. I made a great variety of things as new suggestions came to me\n",
      "almost daily, and also, as my customers called for them, I bought what I\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "154. EASY TOMATOES.--An easy crop, requiring little care. Says a grower\n",
      "in New Jersey: “My single acre of tomatoes netted a clear profit of\n",
      "$120. I am aware that others have realized more than double this sum,\n",
      "but they were experienced hands, while I was new to the business.” Four\n",
      "hundred dollars per acre has frequently been realized from this crop.\n",
      "One person had four acres from which he received from $1,500 to $2,000\n",
      "annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "155. ASSORTED STRAWBERRIES.--Here is the experience of a novice: “I ran\n",
      "a ditch through my wet and almost worthless meadow land, and set it out\n",
      "with strawberry plants. The second year I had an enormous crop. The\n",
      "larger berries were separated from the smaller, and the show thus made\n",
      "by the assorted fruit was magnificent. For 600 quarts I received $300,\n",
      "it being a little early for strawberries in the New York market.” It\n",
      "pays to grow early and large fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "156. LIVINGS IN LETTUCE.--Fifteen thousand heads can be set upon an\n",
      "acre. These at the average price of $1.50 per hundred means $225 per\n",
      "acre. Five acres of this crop should give a fair-sized family a good\n",
      "living. It is an auxiliary crop and may be sowed between heads of\n",
      "cabbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "157. SOVEREIGNS IN SPINACH.--There are few more important crops in\n",
      "market. It requires little labor, can be cultivated evenings and\n",
      "mornings by a busy man, and pays about $75 an acre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "158. THOUSAND-DOLLAR CELERY.--Celery may be grown as a second crop after\n",
      "beets, onions, or peas are cleared up. A little reckoning in the number\n",
      "of heads per acre shows that if the grower could get the consumer’s\n",
      "price of eight or ten cents a head, it would yield a clear profit of\n",
      "$1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "159. FORTUNES IN WATER-CRESS.--“I have no doubt,” says a large grower,\n",
      "“that in situations where irrigation could be used at pleasure, or\n",
      "regular plantations made as for cranberries, judging from the enormous\n",
      "price water-cress sells at, picked as it is in the present haphazard\n",
      "way, an acre would sell for $4,000 or $5,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "160. THE DOLLAR BLACKBERRY.--When the Lawton first came out, so great\n",
      "was the praise of it and the rush to obtain it that many roots were sent\n",
      "through the mail at $1 apiece, and the lucky discoverer netted a small\n",
      "fortune. But any grower has the same chances to discover a new variety,\n",
      "or to improve on his present stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "161. NICKELS IN PICKLES.--Do you know that the enormous number of\n",
      "150,000 cucumbers may be easily grown on an acre of land, and that at\n",
      "the low price of $1.50 per thousand this means $225 per acre? The crop\n",
      "also is very easily raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "162. THE BEET LOT.--You can grow 80,000 roots per acre even when sown a\n",
      "foot apart, yet at $1 per hundred, deducting one-half for expenses,\n",
      "there still results a net value of $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "163. THE ROASTING EAR.--You can plant an acre of sweet corn, realize\n",
      "$100 for it, clear it off in August, sow the cleared ground with turnip\n",
      "seed, and from the second crop reap another $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "164. PAYING PEAS.--They are the early kind, marketed before the price\n",
      "falls. If grown under glass so as to be crowded on the market in early\n",
      "June, they will bring $4 a bushel, and at that rate an acre will mean\n",
      "$400. If delayed a month, they will not bring a quarter of that sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "165. GRATED HORSERADISH.--The root is very easily raised, requires\n",
      "little cultivation, but is quite profitable. Grate finely and put in\n",
      "attractive white bottles with red labels. Give it some fancy name, as\n",
      "“Red Orchard,” or “Spring Valley.” “Little Neck” clams got their\n",
      "reputation largely in this way. Sell for ten cents a bottle.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The field of woman’s work has been vastly augmented during the last\n",
      "half-century. From school teaching and dressmaking, which were about the\n",
      "only occupations open to our grandmothers, the number of ways a woman\n",
      "can make a living have increased to over two hundred. To be exact, there\n",
      "are two hundred and twenty-one occupations open to women, out of a total\n",
      "of two hundred and fifty. It is the design of the author to give only\n",
      "those methods which are unique, unusual, and presumably unknown to most\n",
      "lady readers. In a few cases these money-making methods must be\n",
      "considered as only tributary to a larger source of revenue, as when a\n",
      "salaried position or business enterprise is not sufficient for a\n",
      "support, or when a woman wishes to help the family “eke out a living,”\n",
      "but in most cases it is expected that the suggestions if followed will\n",
      "be an adequate source of income. Several of these ways may often be\n",
      "united where one is insufficient. There is no need for any woman to\n",
      "marry for the sake of a home. The examples given will enable any lady\n",
      "of the least tact, skill, or enterprise, to secure an independent\n",
      "living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "166. THE SCHOOL STORE.--If you live near a public school, a small store\n",
      "containing candies, school supplies and knickknacks for the children\n",
      "will be found to bring much profit. The store need not be large or\n",
      "conspicuous. A room in a private house will do. Children, like bees, are\n",
      "all fond of sweets. The store need be open only for an hour in the\n",
      "morning, or noon, and at the close of school, so that other work may be\n",
      "carried on at the same time. A dressmaker, with hours arranged so as not\n",
      "to conflict, could combine very well these two ways of earning a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "167. THE HAND ALBUM.--Have an album made in usual style, except that the\n",
      "places for pictures are omitted. Smear each page with soft wax to the\n",
      "depth of one-sixth of an inch. When a friend calls, slightly heat a page\n",
      "and request him to lay his hands, palms down, upon it. In that way you\n",
      "can preserve the digits of your friends, and you will be surprised to\n",
      "find there is as much difference in hands as in faces. When your album\n",
      "is full, if you choose you can consult a patent lawyer, and arrange to\n",
      "protect your invention. A novelty of this kind would doubtless be\n",
      "immensely popular, and enable the author to reap a financial harvest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "168. THE NOVELTY BAKERY.--A woman who knows how to make tempting\n",
      "creations in flour can make a good living. Begin by taking your goods to\n",
      "the Woman’s Exchange, of which almost every large city has at least one.\n",
      "If your baking is novel, from the Exchange will come demands from\n",
      "private customers, and even orders from hotels. A New England woman,\n",
      "beginning in a small way, in a few months had an income of $33 per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "169. THE FRONT YARD SNAP.--With a photographer’s outfit, go through the\n",
      "better class residential sections of a city or town and take the\n",
      "pictures of the children which you will see in every street, and in\n",
      "almost every front yard. Get a child in a most striking position, on a\n",
      "wheel, or in a swing or hammock, or at play. Secure parent’s consent to\n",
      "take the picture. No matter if they declare that they will not purchase,\n",
      "they will yield when they see a pretty picture of their child. Much\n",
      "money can be made at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "170. THE PET DOG.--Do you know that pet dogs often bring enormous\n",
      "prices? You want the Yorkshire terriers, or the King Charles spaniels,\n",
      "or some of the rare Japanese breeds. A lady in New York counts on $500\n",
      "yearly as the income from the families raised from one dog, a King\n",
      "Charles spaniel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "171. THE BOX LUNCH.--There is a large field for some one to cultivate in\n",
      "our great office buildings and factories. Thousands would pay for a\n",
      "light lunch which costs five cents, and is sold for ten cents. Rent a\n",
      "small room near a business center. Make known your occupation. Go\n",
      "through the places of business if possible, or if not take a stand near\n",
      "the door, and if your lunch is tastefully arranged, it will find many\n",
      "buyers. After a time you will get regular customers. Profits 100 per\n",
      "cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "172. THE HAIR-DRESSER.--A refined business for women is the dressing of\n",
      "hair. For $25 you can learn the business. Place samples of all kinds of\n",
      "bangs and switches in the window. They can be sold for a great profit,\n",
      "and if industrious, you can build up in a good neighborhood an excellent\n",
      "paying business, and best of all, it can be done in your own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "173. TYPO AND STENO.--In many large cities typewriting and stenography\n",
      "may be learned in the Y. W. C. A. Then with a machine and a rented room\n",
      "cheaply furnished a woman is all ready for business. Many women are\n",
      "making $25 per week. One enterprising young lady takes dictated matter\n",
      "in short hand, and then typewrites it at her leisure, thus saving much\n",
      "time to her busy patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "174. THE SEWING SCHOOL.--Here is a vast unworked field. If you\n",
      "understand needlework, and have a little business enterprise, you are\n",
      "certain to succeed. Advertise in the papers and get out circulars,\n",
      "stating that for the small sum of twenty-five cents per week you will\n",
      "teach all pupils plain and fancy sewing. Form your pupils into classes,\n",
      "and if you are gentle and patient, as well as skillful at the needle,\n",
      "you will in a short time have the work which mothers are glad to get rid\n",
      "of. And it can all be done in your own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "175. FLAT HUNTING.--Rent a small office and advertise that for a\n",
      "trifling fee you will exactly suit persons looking for homes, and save\n",
      "them all the trouble. Three or four hours a day are spent in\n",
      "house-hunting, and two in the office. You must have a book with your\n",
      "customers’ demands set down in detail, and another book with a careful\n",
      "description of each house to let. A commission might be exacted from\n",
      "both owner and renter. An enterprising woman could in a short time\n",
      "build up a large business in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "176. A TEA ROOM.--Hire a counter in a fashionable store much frequented\n",
      "by ladies. Have a sign that fresh tea is sold here, made to order with\n",
      "good cream. Small accessories may be fresh rolls, toasted crumpets,\n",
      "bread and butter, and other light articles of food. Ladies weary with\n",
      "shopping will surely come to your counter to be refreshed. A lady in one\n",
      "of our large cities made a fortune by this means. The requirements are\n",
      "dazzling cleanliness, a smiling welcome, a cheerful place near the door,\n",
      "and hot, fresh tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "177. DRESS MENDING.--Here is a good field. There is a vast army of women\n",
      "who would patronize a mending office rather than run around the city to\n",
      "find a sewing woman, or use their own limited time in the use of the\n",
      "needle. Have a tariff of prices for mending gloves, sewing on buttons,\n",
      "renewing the sleeves, putting braid around the bottom of dresses, etc.\n",
      "The right woman could earn a good living at this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "178. LACE HANDLING.--The mending and washing of fine laces is a work\n",
      "that is given to experts, and commands high prices, yet is easily\n",
      "learned. In five lessons at a dollar apiece any lady of ordinary\n",
      "intelligence can learn, or, cheaper yet, one can sometimes give services\n",
      "in return for instruction. You are then in a position to earn a great\n",
      "deal of money. Issue a thousand circulars to the wealthier people of the\n",
      "city, letting them know of your enterprise. This plan combines the three\n",
      "advantages of fascinating employment, good pay, and work done at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "179. INTELLIGENCE OFFICE on the subscription plan.--Buy a copy of the\n",
      "“Social Register;” send circulars to all persons named therein; announce\n",
      "that you have opened an intelligence office on a new plan. For $10 a\n",
      "year you will keep them supplied with as many servants as they want, and\n",
      "you will guarantee satisfaction. Make a specialty of securing servants\n",
      "for people going out of town. Thus you will go far toward solving the\n",
      "perplexing question for your patrons, and make an excellent living for\n",
      "yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "180. PROFESSIONAL MENDING.--Hotels, boarding houses and bachelor\n",
      "apartments have loud and long calls for mending. Mothers with little\n",
      "ones, professional women, and school-teachers, as well as men, have\n",
      "neither time nor taste for this kind of work. Have an outfit in a small\n",
      "satchel, which should contain a light lunch, a white apron, and various\n",
      "assortments of tapes, buttons, etc. In a short time one would have a\n",
      "regular round of customers. One lady who did this never had to go out of\n",
      "one large hotel for work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "181. THE COLLEGE CRAM.--There is room for a lady with a knowledge of the\n",
      "classics and a faculty for teaching to take boys and young men and carry\n",
      "them over the hard spots in their education. These hard spots, which are\n",
      "known as examinations, conditions, etc., are the bane and bugbear of\n",
      "many a young man’s education. In one town a lady earns $100 per month by\n",
      "taking pupils through the intricacies of algebra and Latin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "182. SHOE AND WRAP ROOM.--A room in some fashionable quarter where\n",
      "ladies could go after a journey on the cars and have the dust brushed\n",
      "off their wraps and their shoes polished would doubtless prove\n",
      "remunerative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "183. GENERAL CONVENIENCE ROOM.--The last idea might be combined with\n",
      "this. Have a room in which, for the charge of a dime, one could get a\n",
      "glass of ice-water, could read the morning paper, have his clothes\n",
      "brushed, and look over a map of the city or a directory, and have all\n",
      "the advantages of a toilet room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "184. SICK-ROOM DELICACIES.--Another unoccupied field is the preparation\n",
      "of delicacies for the sick. Bouillon, chocolate, jellies and many other\n",
      "kinds of delicacies could be prepared and placed in a show window in\n",
      "some fashionable part of the town. The conditions of success are\n",
      "exquisite neatness and daintiness. It would pay well, for people stop at\n",
      "no cost in providing for their sick friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "185. SHOPPING COMMISSION.--If you live at a little distance from the\n",
      "city, a good business may be built up by shopping for your friends and\n",
      "neighbors. By dint of experience you know where to buy, and when your\n",
      "practice is built up you can buy cheaper by reason of larger purchases,\n",
      "and you can give both of these advantages to your patrons. Many women\n",
      "might find here both a congenial and profitable field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "186. SCHOOL LUNCHEON.--Here is another good field. Tens of thousands of\n",
      "schoolchildren have to eat a cold luncheon. Rent a small room near a\n",
      "schoolhouse, and provide bouillon, clam and chicken soups, sandwiches,\n",
      "baked beans, lamb pies, with white and brown bread, plain cake and\n",
      "fruit. You will help to preserve the digestion of myriads of children,\n",
      "as well as fill your own pocket with cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "187. HATCHING BIRDS.--Buy half a dozen songsters at $1.50 apiece, the\n",
      "females at half that price. Get proper cages, mate the birds, provide\n",
      "soft nests made chiefly of cotton; and with care you can do an excellent\n",
      "business. Birds in good condition mate two or three times a year. One\n",
      "lady, with eighteen pairs of canary birds netted $500 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "188. BUTTER AND EGG STORE.--Butter and eggs are two things which every\n",
      "housekeeper wants fresh, but which are difficult to obtain. Get some\n",
      "reliable farmer to supply you at stated dates, and procure a list of\n",
      "customers. Then with a boy to deliver and a push cart for the\n",
      "merchandise, you have little to do but figure your profits. An advantage\n",
      "of this plan is that it gives you the most of your time for other work.\n",
      "The business may be extended almost _ad infinitum_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "189. SARATOGA CHIPS.--These are a sample of what may be done with a\n",
      "single good article by one who knows how. One family has a weekly income\n",
      "of $12.50 from this means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "190. FANCY LAMP SHADES.--Made of crêpe papers they are very cheap, and\n",
      "look almost as well as silk. Any woman of ordinary ability can make\n",
      "them, and they sell readily. She can buy for sixty cents material for a\n",
      "shade which she can sell for $1.25, thus more than doubling her money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "191. BEE-KEEPING.--This is another means of large profit. It can be\n",
      "carried on even in a city where there is a small plot of ground. Fill\n",
      "all the space not occupied by the hives with white clover and such other\n",
      "flowers as your study of bees will tell you they delight in. Buy a book\n",
      "about bees. The advantage of this industry is that the cost of\n",
      "supporting the bees is practically nothing. There is no risk. After the\n",
      "first small expenditure of capital for boxes and hives all is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "192. CLEANSING AND BLEACHING.--There are many things too costly to be\n",
      "intrusted to an ordinary washerwoman, and many other cleansing processes\n",
      "that do not come within that woman’s sphere. Cleaning feathers, velvets,\n",
      "furs, gloves, silks, and many other articles afford a wide opportunity\n",
      "for one who understands the business. Who can take grease spots from\n",
      "carpets, fruit stains from napkins and table covers, paint from windows,\n",
      "thumb-marks from books, and scratches from furniture? Here is a useful\n",
      "field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "193. FANCY SOAPS.--Fortunes have been made from fancy soaps. The process\n",
      "of making is easy, and the variety of method is so great, and the\n",
      "possible ingredients so many, that there need be no danger of infringing\n",
      "on anyone’s trademark. Get a recipe-book and practice on the kinds given\n",
      "in the formulas; then branch out into new kinds. The sale will depend\n",
      "upon your ability. Give your product an attractive appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "194. HOME ARCHITECTURE.--Write to the secretaries or agents of church\n",
      "building societies. Many of these societies publish pamphlets, in which,\n",
      "in addition to the designs for churches, will be found many cuts for\n",
      "pretty little parsonages. From these you can compile an attractive\n",
      "little book of home architecture, which would sell to every person\n",
      "contemplating building a home; and almost every one living in a rented\n",
      "house hopes some day to rear his own domicile. If you have a friend who\n",
      "is an architect, he would procure for you other books of plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "195. HOME ORNAMENTS.--What is a home without at least a few trifling\n",
      "ornaments? An inventive mind can think of a hundred inexpensive ways of\n",
      "beautifying a room. But most people are not inventive. If, therefore,\n",
      "you have that gift, and can think of a few novelties in lace and\n",
      "embroidered goods which you can make and sell for fractions of a dollar,\n",
      "you will have opened your way to constant and remunerative employment.\n",

      "196. DOUBTFUL DEBTS.--It is well known that in efforts that require\n",
      "perseverance and persistence women succeed better than men. Grocers,\n",
      "butchers, real estate agents, and in fact almost every business man, has\n",
      "a large number of accounts, a considerable per cent. of which he\n",
      "considers worthless. To any one who could succeed in collecting them,\n",
      "the dealer would give a very large per cent., in some cases even\n",
      "amounting to half the bill. Many of these are really collectible if\n",
      "attempted with the persuasive arts of womanhood. Here is a large and\n",
      "profitable field for a woman having the right qualifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "197. DRESSING DOLLS.--A fair profit can be made by taking orders for\n",
      "making dolls’ dresses, as they can be bought and dressed for about\n",
      "one-half the cost of those already dressed. Persons giving the order\n",
      "should be required to bring the materials for the dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "198. FRUIT PRESERVERS.--Vast numbers of people are in the country during\n",
      "the fruit season, and cannot “do up” fruits; they must depend on the\n",
      "grocer. Let a thrifty, economical woman who _knows how_ equip herself\n",
      "with sugar, fruit, cans and preserve kettles, and she will not long wait\n",
      "for customers if she makes her business known. The second year, her\n",
      "patrons having tested her talents and tasted her fruits, and finding\n",
      "them so much better than “store goods,” will flood her with orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "199. A MUSHROOM CELLAR.--An enterprising woman hired a cellar at a rent\n",
      "of $10 per month, had it fitted up with shelves, placed on these shelves\n",
      "in order, straw, fertilizers, and soil; then put on mushroom spawn,\n",
      "renewing it at intervals, as also at longer intervals the soil. Average\n",
      "sale of mushrooms per week, $31.50. Average expenses, $8.80. Profit per\n",
      "week, $22.70.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "200. POULTRY RAISING.--Following is the experience of another woman in\n",
      "raising poultry. She bought forty-five Minorcas, because they lay a\n",
      "large white egg, and are nonsitters and prolific layers. Each hen laid\n",
      "on an average one hundred and sixty-four eggs per annum. She purchased\n",
      "also forty Brahmas for sitters and for fattening. Total expenses for\n",
      "fowls and for keeping, $278.70. Total receipts, $1,144.11. Net profit,\n",
      "$865.31.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "201. HOME HOTHOUSE.--Thousands of people will buy plants already started\n",
      "who would not go to the trouble to buy seeds, slips, and pots. There is\n",
      "also a large demand for cut flowers all the year round. Have a cellar\n",
      "for rooting, and a south room for sunning. A liberal use of cards and\n",
      "circulars, stating what you propose to do, will surely bring custom. The\n",
      "secret of the florists’ business is to provide flowers for every month\n",
      "in the year, and to force or retard the flowers that suit the demands of\n",
      "each month. This is a very pretty employment for a woman, and can be\n",
      "done in her own home. There are three hundred and twelve floral\n",
      "establishments in this country managed by women. The work is easy and\n",
      "tasteful to ladies. The elements of success are the habit of early\n",
      "rising, business ability, close superintendence of laborers, intelligent\n",
      "advertising, knowledge of plants, and promptness in filling orders. The\n",
      "best location is near a large cemetery. One florist thus located takes\n",
      "in from $1,500 to $2,000 per month during the busy season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "202. ART NEEDLEWORK.--Here is the way a woman paid off a $600 mortgage\n",
      "on her home, and at the same time attended to her domestic duties. She\n",
      "bought linens stamped with designs, and gave her spare time to\n",
      "decorative embroidery. She disposed of her work at the Woman’s Exchange,\n",
      "and at the art stores. Six hundred dollars in spare minutes are not a\n",
      "bad showing. Besides, one could form a class and add the income from\n",
      "teaching. Mrs. Clara Louise Kellogg began by giving lessons in\n",
      "embroidery at the age of fourteen. Before her fifteenth birthday she was\n",
      "earning $30 a week with these classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "203. NEWS AGENCY.--Keep the daily papers. Almost any lady who will go\n",
      "into the business could count on one hundred patrons; and these by the\n",
      "recommendation of friends could easily be increased to five hundred. One\n",
      "hundred patrons would mean at least $3 per week, and five hundred\n",
      "patrons would mean at least $15 per week. Tact, enterprise, and good\n",
      "service are the qualities needed. If your place is on the main street,\n",
      "and you can make a show-window for periodicals, your income will be much\n",
      "augmented. A woman came to this country and heard of a news stand for\n",
      "sale for $250. She sold her jewels to purchase it. With her two\n",
      "brothers she made it a success, and it now supports three families.\n",
      "“Courtesy and application,” she says, “were my capital.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "204. WOMEN’S WANTS.--Take advantage of bargain sales--ribbons, silks,\n",
      "lace, and velvets. They can be had, if you watch the papers, at very\n",
      "trifling cost, but wondrous are the shapes into which they can be made\n",
      "by woman’s deft fingers. You can make boas, ruchings, berthas, lace\n",
      "bibs, draped collars, belts, etc. Every woman wants these things, and\n",
      "will buy them if they can be found in colors and style required. They\n",
      "can be sold at moderate cost, and at a very large profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "205. HOME PRINTING PRESS.--Pay $10 for a press, and a like sum for type\n",
      "and other accessories. Print visiting cards, at-home cards, business,\n",
      "reception, and wedding cards, tickets of admission, etc. Give a specimen\n",
      "of your work to every one of your friends, and request their patronage;\n",
      "place circulars with samples and rates in the stores, and solicit the\n",
      "favors of business men. Doing the work in your own home, you have no\n",
      "extra rent to pay as have printing establishments, and you can do the\n",
      "work much cheaper and still make a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "206. SHORT SERVICE BUREAU.--Many people want help in an emergency, and\n",
      "for a short time only. The housewife is suddenly taken ill, a servant\n",
      "without warning leaves, company unexpectedly comes, stoves are to be put\n",
      "up, yards are to be cleaned, gardens dug, snow shoveled, clothes washed,\n",
      "and a hundred other things done requiring short service only. Keep a\n",
      "list of men and women who go out at labor. Know accurately their\n",
      "whereabouts every day. Be ready instantly to supply any one’s demand.\n",
      "When it is known that you furnish that kind of service, your office will\n",
      "be in demand, and your patrons well willing to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "207. DELICATESSEN ROOM.--Here is a paying business that is not\n",
      "overcrowded, but success depends upon the quality of the goods. Make\n",
      "yourself a specialist in cookery. Homemade pies, plum puddings, orange\n",
      "marmalade, salted almonds, fancy cakes, jellies and jams can be made and\n",
      "sold at a good profit. Bakers and grocers will be forced to keep them\n",
      "when once there is a demand for your goods. This is no speculative idea.\n",
      "Many a woman has not only made a living, but accumulated a snug little\n",
      "fortune by this means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "208. MISCELLANEOUS EXCHANGE.--Many people have no use for some of their\n",
      "possessions, but desire something else; others would be glad to get what\n",
      "these possess. Establish a place for the exchange of typewriters, sewing\n",
      "machines, bicycles, baby carriages, jewelry, bric-à-brac, etc. Charge\n",
      "both parties to the exchange a small commission. This plan has the\n",
      "advantage that it requires no capital, and hence has no risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "209. CAP AND APRON PLAN.--Here is a plan available near any large hotel.\n",
      "Have a place for the sale of aprons, waiters’ jackets, cooks’ caps, etc.\n",
      "Get out a great quantity of circulars, stating your plan in an\n",
      "attractive form, and have a boy to distribute them--one upon whom you\n",
      "can rely to hand one to every employee of hotel shop and store. Repeat\n",
      "the circulars every week until your business is thoroughly known.\n",
      "Arrange to keep the articles in repair, and engage the agency of some\n",
      "laundry establishment for their washing; then with the work of selling,\n",
      "repairing and laundrying these goods you will have an established\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "210. KITCHEN UTENSILS.--As a rule you can sell five kitchen utensils\n",
      "where you can sell one book. The former shows for itself; the latter\n",
      "must be exhibited and explained. Send to a large wholesaler for the most\n",
      "modern samples of labor-saving tools for the kitchen. Test them for a\n",
      "few days yourself. Then start out among your neighbors. A housewife will\n",
      "purchase anything that lightens labor if it is only cheap. An\n",
      "enthusiastic person can make many dollars a day selling useful articles\n",
      "for the kitchen. A woman for three months averaged $4 a day selling an\n",
      "improved coffee pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "211. WEDDING MANAGER.--How many brides shrink from the work of a large\n",
      "wedding, while at the same time feeling under obligations to have one! A\n",
      "lady who has an artistic taste and a knowledge of the best social\n",
      "customs may very properly undertake the management of a wedding. She\n",
      "should know what is proper for the bride’s outfit, and how to dress her,\n",
      "how to decorate the rooms, what style of invitations to issue, and in\n",
      "short, all the delightfully perplexing details of a wedding. For this\n",
      "work she has a right to charge a fair sum, and if the wedding proves to\n",
      "be a very pretty one, she is entitled to the credit of it. When once the\n",
      "office of a lady manager is recognized, and the relief afforded to the\n",
      "bride’s family appreciated, the fashion will quickly spread, and others\n",
      "will wish to avail themselves of your taste and skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "212. FOREIGN HOMES.--Here is an example of the pluck and enterprise of\n",
      "an American girl: Miss Mary Widdicomb went to Paris in company with a\n",
      "lady friend, and established a home for Americans in that capital. Her\n",
      "rooms accommodated thirty-five, and such was the success of her venture\n",
      "that she is about to open another apartment. Think of it! You can go to\n",
      "a French city and hear the American language, associate with American\n",
      "people, and have American surroundings the same as if in the United\n",
      "States. Here is an opportunity for young women with small capital to see\n",
      "a foreign country and make money at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "213. LADY BARBER.--There is a school in New York for the instruction of\n",
      "barbers. Three months’ apprenticeship will give you a knowledge of the\n",
      "trade. One lady who graduated a year ago from the school now has two\n",
      "assistants, and is earning from $6 to $10 a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "214. MINERAL COLLECTIONS FOR SCHOOLS.--Dana’s Mineralogy gives fourteen\n",
      "hundred places in the United States where rare minerals are found. There\n",
      "are 240,968 public schools, and each one needs a mineral collection. Why\n",
      "has no one thought of gathering these rare stones and selling them to\n",
      "our public schools? At $1 a school, the sale should be $240,698, but\n",
      "many rare collections would bring $5, and even $10 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "215. TURKISH BATH.--One lady opened a place for Turkish and Russian\n",
      "baths. She went around among her lady friends and acquaintances and\n",
      "secured the promise of a paying patronage. Five promised their patronage\n",
      "every week, eight every two weeks, and twenty-four at least once a\n",
      "month. Thus the sum of $60 per month was assured at the start, and this\n",
      "paid for rent and assistants, with a good margin of profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "216. TRAINED NURSES.--Trained nurses in our large cities command $25 a\n",
      "week. The duties are exacting, but not difficult. Assistant nurses\n",
      "receive $15. The latter have less responsibilities, and are not required\n",
      "to spend so long a time in training. This is an inviting field for\n",
      "ladies who have gifts and tastes for this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "217. TRAVELING COMPANION.--If you have a good education and can make\n",
      "yourself agreeable, your services ought not to go long begging for an\n",
      "engagement in this delightful occupation. Watch the advertisements in\n",
      "the daily papers; better yet, insert an advertisement of your own,\n",
      "modestly stating your qualifications. The remuneration depends upon the\n",
      "wealth and liberality of your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "218. PAPER FLOWERS.--This has become a distinct trade. You can learn in\n",
      "a few months. There is a paper flower store in Broadway, New York, which\n",
      "does an immense business. There are great possibilities in this line in\n",
      "every city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "219. FRENCH PERFUMER AND COMPLEXION EXPERT.--How does this\n",
      "sound?--Madame Racier, French Perfumer. Equip yourself with perfumes,\n",
      "essences, tinctures, extracts, spirit waters, cosmetics, infusions,\n",
      "pastiles, tooth powders, washes, cachous, hair dyes, sachets, essential\n",
      "oils, etc. All ladies like perfumes. Once let it be known that you are\n",
      "an authority on the subject, and you will lack neither patronage nor\n",
      "profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "220. A WOMAN’S HOTEL.--A hotel exclusively for women would no doubt be a\n",
      "paying investment. More than fifty thousand ladies without male escorts\n",
      "stop every year in the hotels of New York City. A very large proportion\n",
      "of this number would patronize a cheap, clean, well-kept place, fitted\n",
      "up and conducted solely for the comfort of ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "221. GUIDE FOR SHOPPERS.--A department store in New York recently made a\n",
      "census of its customers, and from the count kept for a single week it\n",
      "was estimated that 3,125,000 persons passed through its doors every\n",
      "year. This for a single store. But there are thousands of stores. Vast\n",
      "numbers of these people are from the country, and do not know where they\n",
      "can trade to the best advantage. What a field is here for a shoppers’\n",
      "guide! Ascertain what stores make a specialty of certain goods, what\n",
      "ones sell the cheapest in certain lines, and what days they make\n",
      "bargains in certain wares. Show by what routes the places are best\n",
      "reached, where to dine, etc. Fill a little book with just the\n",
      "information a shopper wants to know; call it “The Ladies’ Shopping\n",
      "Guide,” put it on the market at ten cents, and you can sell millions of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "222. BICYCLE INSTRUCTION.--Why, may not a woman teach “the wheel” as\n",
      "well as a man? Many women are restrained from learning through the\n",
      "dislike of falling from the wheel into the arms of a strange man,\n",
      "commonly a negro. A woman’s bicycle academy would pay in any large city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "223. COOKING SCHOOL.--Madam Parloa and Madam Rorer have set the example,\n",
      "and they will be sure to have many imitators. A course of instruction in\n",
      "cooking, costing $10, is a vastly better investment to any young woman\n",
      "than a course on a piano costing $100, or many times that sum. First,\n",
      "learn the art thoroughly yourself and then teach it to others. There is\n",
      "money in this, but it needs taste, tact and work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "224. THE BOARDING HOUSE.--One who has a taste for cooking and a little\n",
      "marketing skill can do well in this somewhat overworked and not always\n",
      "paying business. The gains increase from zero with one boarder, in\n",
      "geometrical progression, until $1 a head is realized with twenty\n",
      "boarders. Profits, $20 a week. With great skill and management this may\n",
      "be doubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "225. PEN ENGRAVING.--If you have a circle of one hundred friends, and\n",
      "can secure their patronage, you can make a fair living for one person at\n",
      "engraving cards. A lady with a large calling list should engrave $500\n",
      "worth of cards a year. Expenses, $25. Remuneration for work, $475.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "226. A LADIES’ RESTAURANT.--A restaurant where delicacies pleasing to\n",
      "ladies are made a specialty would surely pay. A lady who recently\n",
      "established one adjoining a large department store has been obliged to\n",
      "enlarge her premises to accommodate her crowd of patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "227. A WOMAN’S NEWSPAPER.--One has just been started in a Western city.\n",
      "The editors, reporters, printers, and press-feeders, are all women. Of\n",
      "course it advocates woman’s reform. An enterprise of this kind requires\n",
      "considerable capital, and is not without risk, but a woman of ability\n",
      "and experience can make it pay as well as a man, besides the advantage\n",
      "of an appeal directly to her sex in support of a paper conducted in this\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "228. ADVERTISING AGENT.--A lady by her courtesy, tact, and gentle\n",
      "address, is especially fitted for this work. All our great newspapers\n",
      "and magazines pay large salaries to successful agents, for, as a rule,\n",
      "the advertising department is the one that pays the dividends of the\n",
      "business. The shopkeepers and others who, by reason of repeated\n",
      "solicitations give the cold shoulder to the male agent, would listen at\n",
      "least respectfully to a lady. On the whole, this field presents to\n",
      "ladies who have the right qualities better opportunities than to men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "229. THE CIVIL SERVICE.--This is now open to women. There are more then\n",
      "ten thousand of these places to be filled every year. Clerkships range\n",
      "from $600 to $3,000. Very few fall below $1,000. These places, according\n",
      "to the Civil Service Law, are filled by competitive examinations. There\n",
      "are thousands of bright young women who secured these places, not\n",
      "through any governmental pull, but by sheer merit in examinations. Get a\n",
      "book entitled “Civil Service,” by John M. Comstock, Chairman of the\n",
      "United States Board of Examiners, for the Customs Service in New York\n",
      "City, and published by Henry Holt & Co. This book will give you a\n",
      "complete table of the positions open, the salaries attached to each, and\n",
      "a list of questions required to be answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "230. POST-PRANDIAL CLASSES.--Few, even among educated women, are masters\n",
      "of themselves to the extent of being able to rise before an audience,\n",
      "and without previous preparation express themselves clearly and\n",
      "creditably on whatever subject may be under discussion. A woman in New\n",
      "York, a member of Sorosis, made a reputation for bright, witty,\n",
      "after-dinner speeches. As she earned her living by newspaper work, a\n",
      "friend said to her, “Why don’t you add to your income by teaching other\n",
      "women how to say a few graceful words in public?” She caught at the\n",
      "idea, and organized classes in the hitherto untaught art of\n",
      "post-prandial speech-making, and had capital success, earning $500 by it\n",
      "in one season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "231. WOMEN DRUGGISTS.--The neatness of women, their delicacy and\n",
      "attention to details, qualify them admirably for the drug business. At\n",
      "the Woman’s Infirmary, New York, the apothecary department is entirely\n",
      "in the hands of ladies. Drug clerks receive on the average of $9 per\n",
      "week. There are few lady proprietors, but there is no reason why there\n",
      "should not be more, as the business is very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "232. ALMANAC MAKERS.--Of late years many of the great dailies issue\n",
      "yearly almanacs. The mass of matter which goes to make up these\n",
      "publications can be collected as well by women, who have gifts for\n",
      "details, as by those of the other sex. In one publication house a woman\n",
      "is paid $30 a week to manage one of these almanacs, and in another $20\n",
      "for the compiling of an index for the daily paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "233. WOMEN LECTURERS.--Women of talent have earned a competence and\n",
      "almost a fortune on the platform. Lucy Stone was sometimes paid as high\n",
      "as $260 for a lecture, and Anna Dickinson also received large sums. The\n",
      "lady who hopes to succeed in this field must have fluency, the gift of\n",
      "oratory, self-poise, and a certain dramatic or magnetic power.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "234. MAGAZINE CONTRIBUTORS.--In this work women are paid as much as men,\n",
      "and their facile pens are often able to turn out equal and even\n",
      "superior work. The Harpers pay $10 a page; the Atlantic Monthly, $6 to\n",
      "$10; the North American Review, $1.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "235. WOMEN PHYSICIANS.--Says a recent publication: “There is a real\n",
      "necessity for women physicians; there are many ladies who prefer them,\n",
      "and in some cases will consult no other. There are now over one thousand\n",
      "lady physicians in the United States, but the number will soon be\n",
      "doubled, and even trebled. Several of these lady physicians are making\n",
      "over $2,000 a year.” One of them says: “I have several well-to-do\n",
      "families whom I charge by the year. I charge $200, if they are people\n",
      "who are considered well off; less, if they are poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "236. PAPER BOX MAKING.--Hundreds of women are making paper boxes, but as\n",
      "employees, not as proprietors. A woman made the first orange box in\n",
      "California. Seeing that it was a good thing, and that there would soon\n",
      "be a demand for others, she built a factory, and is now turning out\n",
      "fifty thousand boxes a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "237. HORTICULTURE.--Here is an example of what a California woman can\n",
      "do. A widow having four boys purchased thirty-six acres of land in San\n",
      "Jose, and under her personal care, aided by her boys, planted the tract\n",
      "with apricot, cherry and prune trees. For four years she did all the\n",
      "pruning, a difficult task for a refined and delicate woman, accustomed\n",
      "as she had been to luxuriant ease. Her prune trees alone netted $2,700\n",
      "in one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "238. VOCALISTS.--A lady with a good voice is certain of making a\n",
      "living, some have made fortunes with it. The demand is wide and various.\n",
      "If your taste does not incline to the stage, there is still a large\n",
      "field in the church. All large churches, and many small ones now, have\n",
      "paid choirs. The leading vocalists are commonly well paid. There are a\n",
      "great number of altos and sopranos in New York and Brooklyn, and in the\n",
      "fashionable suburbs, who receive $1,000 a year, or an excess of that\n",
      "sum. And this is an excellent compensation when it is remembered that\n",
      "the singer has nearly all her time in which to pursue some other\n",
      "vocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "239. PACKING TRUNKS.--This is a Paris occupation carried on exclusively\n",
      "by women. You leave your order at the office of the transportation\n",
      "company, and say when you want a professional packer. She comes, and is\n",
      "paid fifty cents, and sometimes $1 an hour for her services. She has\n",
      "genius for folding dresses so that they can be carried all over the\n",
      "world without a wrinkle. She wraps bonnets in tissue paper. She tucks\n",
      "away bric-à-brac in a way that makes breakage impossible. This industry\n",
      "might be introduced profitably into this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "240. WOMEN COSTUMERS.--Costumes for the stage are now gotten up mostly\n",
      "by men. A woman of taste and ability could make a success of this\n",
      "business. Many rich ladies would consult them in matters of personal\n",
      "wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "241. EXPRESS OFFICE.--A woman can sit in an office as well as a man. One\n",
      "woman in Boston tried it four years ago, beginning in a modest way. Now\n",
      "she has three offices and five teams in constant use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "242. A FANCY BAKERY.--An elegant and educated young woman in San\n",
      "Francisco took a dingy, dying little bakeshop, with sickening sights and\n",
      "smells. She put it in order. In two months she had cleared $700, and in\n",
      "four months $1,800. Another woman in Brooklyn has just opened a bakery\n",
      "under very flattering prospects. She works on the plan of exquisite\n",
      "neatness, trimming her windows like those of a fancy goods’ dealer, and\n",
      "wrapping her bread in tissue paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "243. WOMEN GROCERS.--There are not many women in the grocer business,\n",
      "but there is no reason why there should not be. A woman grocer in a\n",
      "Western State who has been established since 1860, has a business worth\n",
      "$80,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "244. FOOD AND MEDICINE SAMPLES.--Proprietors of patent medicines and\n",
      "foods will give you a large commission to introduce their inventions\n",
      "into homes, and if successful, you will soon be employed at a good\n",
      "salary. These proprietors often pay ladies to introduce samples at\n",
      "country stores. The storekeeper will give you room rent free for a few\n",
      "days, with the understanding that he alone has the sale of the article\n",
      "in the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "245. SAMPLES IN STORES.--Ladies of tact and good address are receiving\n",
      "fair salaries in the introduction of new articles. Every inventor is\n",
      "anxious to introduce his goods, and every storekeeper is equally\n",
      "desirous to sell. Call upon the proprietor of some new article of\n",
      "household use, secure territory, and then solicit space in a country\n",
      "store. After three or four days in one store you should go to another,\n",
      "or perhaps to the next town. You may have to begin on a commission, but\n",
      "if successful you can soon command a salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "246. SAMPLES FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.--Others find ample remuneration in\n",
      "introducing new articles from house to house. We know a little lady in\n",
      "Brooklyn who is paid well for giving away samples of a new baby food.\n",
      "This is much more pleasant work than that of importuning people to\n",
      "purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "247. THE WOMAN BEAUTIFIER.--Whatever is of the nature of beauty appeals\n",
      "to the heart of woman. A lady who has the secret of making other women\n",
      "beautiful cannot fail of success. After making a study of your business,\n",
      "advertise that you understand the art of removing moles, wrinkles,\n",
      "warts, wens, birthmarks, tan, freckles, and superfluous hair. If\n",
      "successful in pleasing one or two leaders of fashion, you will have\n",
      "plenty of custom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "248. THE MANICURE PARLOR.--The manicure business is yearly increasing.\n",
      "For $15 you can learn the business. Implements will cost you $10 more.\n",
      "With the capital of $25 you can begin business, and, if ladylike in\n",
      "appearance and gentle in touch, you can build up a big business in the\n",
      "right neighborhood. Any lady would prefer in this art to patronize one\n",
      "of her own sex. Get out cards and circulars and scatter them freely.\n",
      "There is room for many women to excel in this field. One lady who\n",
      "entered upon this work two years ago says she is on the road to a\n",
      "fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "249. THE MASSAGE TREATMENT.--Another lady is having great success with\n",
      "the massage treatment. She has now more than seventy regular patrons.\n",
      "This method of cure is easily learned and readily applied. Hardly a\n",
      "lady among your acquaintances is in good health. It is a proverb that no\n",
      "woman is well. A vast proportion of these cases are nervous and will\n",
      "yield to the massage treatment. If you have strong muscles you could\n",
      "readily achieve a large practice by this system, especially in summer\n",
      "resorts and places where invalids flock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "250. ICE CREAM PARLOR.--This is not new, but possesses possibilities of\n",
      "a good living where the field is not overworked. There are five things\n",
      "necessary to success, and in the following order of importance: An\n",
      "attractive place in a clean, fashionable locality; good and generous\n",
      "plates of cream; unexcelled neatness; polite service; and popular\n",
      "prices. We have known a lady commencing business on these principles to\n",
      "oust quickly an older establishment run on slacker methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "251. FLOWER PACKETS.--Buy quantities of flower seeds of all varieties.\n",
      "Put them up in very small envelopes, a few seeds in each one, advertise\n",
      "that you will send samples for a penny a kind, ten for six cents,\n",
      "twenty-five for fifteen cents, fifty for twenty-five cents, etc. A large\n",
      "mail envelope will hold fifty or more of the smaller ones containing\n",
      "seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "252. LADY CATERER.--A woman has a fine chance to succeed as a caterer.\n",
      "Her taste in arranging tables should at least make her hold her own with\n",
      "business rivals of the opposite sex. Mrs. A. B. Marshall, a woman\n",
      "caterer of London, often manages a supper for one hundred guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "253. DELICACIES FOR INVALIDS.--This is a new field which is being\n",
      "worked with much promise. “Mrs. Kate Teachman,” as she is known in the\n",
      "New York _Sun_, is working in this line with great success. She says:\n",
      "“Of course, if you want this sort of thing you must pay for\n",
      "it--sixty-five cents for a pint of broth, seventy-five cents for a pint\n",
      "of puree, sixty-five cents for a half-pint of jelly, twenty-five cents\n",
      "for chopped chicken sandwiches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "254. INSECT POWDER.--A California woman who now owns four hundred acres\n",
      "of land has a history that ought to inspire other women with a belief in\n",
      "their ability to get on in the world. In 1861 her husband died, leaving\n",
      "her with a debt of $1,400, three children, and a small farm mortgaged.\n",
      "Within five years she had paid the mortgage by taking boarders, raising\n",
      "chickens, and doing whatever offered. In 1877 she began to raise\n",
      "pyrethrum, the plant from which insect powder is made, some years having\n",
      "one hundred acres planted with it. Now she has from fifty to eighty\n",
      "employees of both sexes, and is said to be worth half a million dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "255. RICE CULTIVATOR.--A few years ago a young Iowa girl-squatter, with\n",
      "her sixteen-year-old brother, took up a government claim in Louisiana,\n",
      "and went to planting rice, the first crop of which paid her $1,000. She\n",
      "lives in a three-room cottage, and has a few fruit trees, plenty of good\n",
      "fences, and a sea of waving rice-blades. Her nearest neighbor is another\n",
      "girl-farmer who also settled a government claim, and is bossing an\n",
      "orchard that is giving her a comfortable living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "256. YEAST CAKES.--Here is what one woman did: Being thrown on her own\n",
      "resources, instead of following the beaten path of custom, she engaged\n",
      "in something novel. She made yeast cakes. Gradually her trade increased\n",
      "until she was obliged to hire help, and in time had to build an addition\n",
      "to the house to provide room for her thriving business. She now makes a\n",
      "good living, finding her work congenial as well as profitable. Here is\n",
      "her recipe: Take one dozen hops and boil two or three hours, remove from\n",
      "the fire and strain through a sieve, adding boiling water until there\n",
      "are three or four quarts of the liquid. Then thicken with canaille until\n",
      "quite stiff; and one-half tablespoonful of ginger and one-quarter cup of\n",
      "molasses; let it stand until cool, add one-half cup of salt yeast, or\n",
      "one cake of lard, and in the morning stir down with a little fine\n",
      "cornmeal. Let it rise again, then mix with cornmeal, roll, and cut with\n",
      "a cutter. This rule makes one hundred cakes. They sell for seventy-five\n",
      "cents per hundred, and retail for one cent apiece.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "257. PHYSICAL CULTURE.--There are twelve million young women in the\n",
      "United States. The great majority of them have an ailment of some kind;\n",
      "in fact, it is almost impossible to find a perfectly healthy woman.\n",
      "Physical culture will add years to one’s life. An eminent physician has\n",
      "estimated that twenty-four million years, or an average of two years\n",
      "each, can be added to the lives of our young women by simple bodily\n",
      "exercise of one hour each day. Get a book, study a chart, employ a\n",
      "teacher; then, after a thorough course go about among your friends and\n",
      "form a class. Induce your pupils to bring other pupils. Advertise,\n",
      "lecture, give class exhibitions. Charge $5 a quarter for a class of\n",
      "twelve; $4 for one of fifteen; $3 for one of twenty. Mr. John D. Hoover,\n",
      "of Los Angeles, Cal., says: “When I entered a college of oratory, I was\n",
      "almost penniless. I took a special course in physical culture, with a\n",
      "view to teaching that art. It is now eighteen months since I left the\n",
      "college, and during that time I have earned in clear cash from teaching\n",
      "physical culture the sum of $20,960. I have 1,507 pupils. My sister also\n",
      "has been very successful in teaching since she graduated, and has made\n",
      "quite a large sum of money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "258. HOUSE CLEANING.--Enterprising men have taken up the work of house\n",
      "cleaning with considerable success, but the business can be managed\n",
      "better by a woman than by a man. If your patrons are not too many, you\n",
      "can personally superintend the work in each house yourself to the great\n",
      "satisfaction of the lady, who would commonly prefer to have it managed\n",
      "by one of her own sex. If your business increases so as to require your\n",
      "presence in the office, you can send a lady assistant to superintend the\n",
      "work. Have a fixed price per room where there is no extra work, such as\n",
      "painting, kalsomining, and paper hanging. In the latter case it is\n",
      "better to take the work by the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "259. SELLING OYSTERS.--Here is the way a woman with five little children\n",
      "gets a living: She hires a boy to open the oysters, which she then puts\n",
      "up in little pint pails and takes from house to house. She has many\n",
      "customers whom she serves regularly on certain days. Sales per week,\n",
      "fifty pints, or twenty-five quarts. Boy’s wages, $1. Net, $3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "260. PIE CART.--Hear what another woman says: “I have a little pie cart.\n",
      "It is nothing but a pie-crate mounted on wheels. I bake every morning\n",
      "ten pies and in the afternoon I sell them hot from door to door. I make\n",
      "about seven cents on a large pie, and four cents on small one.” Average\n",
      "earnings per day, fifty cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "261. MEN’S NECK TIES.--As every man, at least every well-dressed man,\n",
      "wears a tie, which must be renewed several times a year--white lawns\n",
      "every day--the number in demand is enormous. First learn the business,\n",
      "and then if you can sell them a little under the manufacturers’ price\n",
      "you are sure to dispose of all you can make. One girl earned $12 a week\n",
      "in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "262. DANCING TEACHER.--The natural grace of women fits them better than\n",
      "men to be teachers of this art, especially to be instructors of young\n",
      "girls. Dancing teachers charge on the average $15 a quarter. There are\n",
      "several very successful lady teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "263. HABERDASHER.--The selling of small articles of the dress and toilet\n",
      "is profitable if the location is good and the competition not too\n",
      "severe. Where one cannot purchase the articles outright, she can sell on\n",
      "commission. Dealers in small wares of this kind often take in from $12\n",
      "to $20 a day, of which on the average, one-sixth is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "264. LADY ARCHITECT.--There is no reason why women should not succeed in\n",
      "this occupation, since it is one in which taste is a chief requisite.\n",
      "Several young lady graduates of college have entered it recently, and\n",
      "with flattering success. Architects charge about three per cent. on\n",
      "contracts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "265. LOST AND FOUND AGENCY.--In every large city numbers of articles are\n",
      "lost by the owners and found by others every day. A single New York\n",
      "paper contains daily from ten to twenty advertisements of lost\n",
      "articles. Open a small office, advertise in the “Lost and Found” column\n",
      "of the paper that you will receive any articles that may be found, and\n",
      "charge the owner a small commission. The agency could be carried on in\n",
      "connection with some other light business.\n",

      "Wilson. But the first became one of the greatest of scientists; the\n",

      "“The best school is the school of adversity,” said Rousseau, who, from a\n",
      "waiter in a restaurant, became the most noted man of his age. The boy,\n",
      "Horace Greeley, wandered up and down the streets of New York, asking of\n",
      "printers if they “wanted a hand,” and was everywhere laughed at and\n",
      "turned away; and the boy, George W. Childs, worked for $2 a week as a\n",
      "clerk in a book store, saved money, bought the Philadelphia _Ledger_,\n",
      "and became a millionaire.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I have no capital,” you say. But you have ten servants (fingers) to\n",

      "commenced in a book store at $1.25 a week. Fred Douglass, the colored\n",
      "orator, began life as a slave without a cent. And P. T. Barnum, the\n",
      "world-famed showman, rode a horse for ten cents a day. No chances! You\n",
      "have _five_ on each hand. No capital! It is the _blood_ that fights and\n",
      "wins. If you have no opportunity, make it. Do not wait for something to\n",
      "turn up; _turn_ something up. Be a match for events. The world’s great\n",
      "and rich men have forced their way to success at the bayonet points of\n",
      "their fingers, and with the iron pry of an unconquerable will. Boys,\n",
      "here are a few hints for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_Section 1. How a Boy can Get a Place._\n",
      "\n",
      "SEVEN WAYS TO GET A POSITION.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "266. FREE SERVICE.--Make friends with a clerk. Offer to go with him on\n",
      "the delivery wagon. He will be only too glad of your assistance. The\n",
      "next step will be to help in odd jobs about the store. After a little\n",
      "familiarity with the business, you will find an opening. Your friendly\n",
      "clerk will have a sick day, or a leave of absence, or a vacation. The\n",
      "employer knows you have assisted the clerk, and will gladly give you his\n",
      "place for a day or a week, and from temporary employment it is but a\n",
      "step to a permanent place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "267. SPECIAL DEPARTMENT.--Make yourself familiar with a particular\n",
      "department of the work of shop or store. Suppose you take a pound of\n",
      "tea. It will surprise you to find out how many things you can learn\n",
      "about so insignificant a thing as a pound of tea. Ascertain the\n",
      "different brands; what markets they come from; where they are raised;\n",
      "how they are manufactured; in what quantities they are shipped; what\n",
      "are the fluctuations in price; who are the largest dealers; in what\n",
      "section of the country the trade is chiefly carried on. A study of these\n",
      "things will suggest other branches. A year given to a study of this\n",
      "kind, and you will know more about tea than the most trusted employee,\n",
      "whose knowledge is commonly of a superficial kind. Then, if you have an\n",
      "opportunity, you can surprise the merchant with a knowledge of his\n",
      "business, and he will be sure to give you a place as soon as he has an\n",
      "opening. One merchant says: “I always have a place for a person who can\n",
      "tell me anything about my business I don’t know myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "268. SHOW SUPERIORITY OF GOODS.--A man occupied his spare moments in\n",
      "measuring the linear feet of advertisements contained in the different\n",
      "Sunday papers, and sent the result to the one which had printed the\n",
      "most. Go around among customers and find what brand of goods they like\n",
      "the best. Then report to the makers of these brands, and you may be sure\n",
      "they will take an interest in you if they see that you take an interest\n",
      "in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "269. ADVERTISING.--Here is an advertisement for the right kind of boy:\n",
      "“A brisk-footed, up-to-date boy, not afraid to work, will take a place\n",

      "forms you will be able to produce, the pleasure of the work, and above\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "275. THE DIME LUNCH.--There are thousands of business men and clerks in\n",
      "our large stores and offices who would prefer to pay ten or fifteen\n",
      "cents rather than go out to a restaurant. Especially is this the case in\n",
      "rainy weather. Pretty boxes with tasteful lunches could be prepared at a\n",
      "small cost, and taken through the places of business. The important item\n",
      "is attractiveness.\n",
      "\n",

      "pay you for canceled stamps. Ordinary stamps bring about ten cents per\n",
      "thousand, but rare ones bring very high prices. Ask all your friends for\n",

      "can make money easily by printing cards and doing other small press\n",

      "five cents admission. As you become more expert, you can increase your\n",

      "to carry messages, roll out barrels of ashes, go on errands, mail\n",
      "letters, black boots, and do whatever work they may require. If the work\n",

      "and thus insure punctuality.\n",

      "Many persons would gladly give you a truck-load. But these are worth\n",

      "elderly gentlemen, who would like to learn to ride a wheel, but do not\n",
      "like the publicity of a riding academy. Issue some neat cards and\n",
      "circulate them from house to house with the information that for the sum\n",
      "of $1 you will teach any one to ride. Most people have a back yard where\n",
      "such instruction could be given. Having no rent to pay, you could easily\n",
      "afford to take them for that price, as you have the advantage over the\n",
      "professional instructor, both of cheapness and privacy. There is a lot\n",
      "of money in this for the right kind of a boy.\n",

      "286. FIRST-COST SALES.--When public attention is aroused upon any\n",
      "subject, consider how you can turn it to account. Here is what a boy\n",
      "thirteen years old says: “When ‘Coin’s Financial School’ came out and\n",
      "the people were talking about it, I wrote to Mr. Harvey, the author, and\n",
      "got a lot of the books and sold them all before they got into the book\n",
      "stores here. I have made in this and like enterprises $500.” Like\n",
      "opportunities were presented in our late war, with the Dewey buttons,\n",

      "Few occupations offer such inducements for persons with little or no\n",
      "capital as that of the agent. There are two classes of agencies. In one,\n",
      "as a book or patent agency, the agent works for one or two persons at a\n",
      "fixed commission and needs no capital. In the other, as that of servants\n",
      "and of supply companies, the agent is also in a certain sense a\n",
      "principal; he obeys no one’s orders, fixes his own commissions, and\n",
      "makes his profits directly from the public. Here are a few points for\n",
      "agents:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "287. BOOK AGENCY.--The book agency depends partly upon the kind of book,\n",
      "but chiefly upon the kind of man. The right man selling the right book\n",
      "can make enormous wages. An agent selling a commentary on the Bible made\n",
      "sometimes $25 in half a day. An agent for the “People’s Encyclopædia”\n",
      "earned $3,000 in one year, and spent only about half the time in the\n",
      "work. Many agents for “Memoirs of General Grant” earned from $10 to $20\n",
      "a day. Ordinarily, an agent should be satisfied if he can make from $3\n",
      "to $5 a day. From this sum must come his expenses. Book agents receive\n",
      "from 25 to 45 per cent., according to the nature of the work. Forty per\n",
      "cent. is considered excellent compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "288. THE PATENT AGENCY.--Considerable business is now done in the\n",
      "selling of patent rights. The agent studies the lists that come out\n",
      "weekly in the “United States Patent Gazette,” and sends his circulars to\n",
      "those who have secured patents. The agent will charge from five to ten\n",
      "per cent., if he can arrange with a patentee for the sale of the\n",
      "patents. In other cases, he charges a fixed sum, which is paid in\n",
      "advance, and is considered an equivalent for his services whether or not\n",
      "he is successful in effecting a sale, on the same principle that doctors\n",
      "and lawyers are paid whether they gain or lose a case. In extent and\n",
      "profit, the business varies from the itinerant vender with half a dozen\n",
      "patents in his valise to the established business house with\n",
      "sub-agencies in all parts of the world. What the profits are in the\n",
      "latter situation may be judged from a single case in the former, where a\n",
      "traveling man received as commission on a single patent sold the sum of\n",
      "$5,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "289. COMMISSION MERCHANTS.--A vast business is done in the sale of\n",
      "general merchandise on commission. Foreign houses have their agencies in\n",
      "this city. Also much of the produce of the farm and of the products of\n",
      "manufactures are disposed of in the same way. Take a case of the former\n",
      "kind. A man hires an office in New York and storage in a warehouse. Then\n",
      "he sends circulars to Westerndealers, stating that he is prepared to\n",
      "take their stock or grain on commission. When he can make quick sales he\n",
      "saves the expense of storage, but rental in a warehouse is necessary in\n",
      "holding for futures. He receives in one day 100,000 bushels of wheat at\n",
      "seventy-five cents per bushel, which, after paying freightage, he sells\n",
      "at one half of one per cent. profit. Gain of one day, $500. He will not\n",
      "receive so much every day, and some days he will have to sell at a loss;\n",
      "but, taken altogether, there are good chances of wealth in the\n",
      "commission business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "290. INSURANCE AGENCY.--Insurance, both fire and life, is a mine of\n",
      "wealth, and has opened wondrously during the last few years. The present\n",
      "magnitude of the business is shown by the statement that there are\n",
      "$2,500,000,000 invested in life insurance in the United States, while\n",
      "the fire insurance agents last year wrote more than $16,000,000,000.\n",
      "There are seven men who have an aggregate of $7,000,000 on their lives.\n",
      "But the business is yet in its infancy. The field of life insurance is\n",
      "not nearly covered, and if it were, ten million persons will come to\n",
      "maturity during the next ten years, all of whom may be considered as\n",
      "candidates for insurance, and all the policies will have to be renewed\n",
      "in a short time. Insurance agents receive as commission from ten to\n",
      "twenty-five per cent. Some companies secure to their agents a regular\n",
      "percentage on the premium so long as the policies continue in force. If,\n",
      "therefore, an agent gets fifteen per cent. commission, and the company\n",
      "receives $10,000 per year as premiums from the policies he has written,\n",
      "his share will be $1,500; and thus he enjoys an annuity without any\n",
      "further work for a long period of time. The larger old-time companies,\n",
      "also, have general agents whose positions are still more lucrative. Many\n",
      "of them are in circumstances of affluence, and have very little to do.\n",
      "In fact, it is in the insurance business as in many other occupations,\n",
      "that as one rises the salaries are larger, and the actual work, aside\n",
      "from the responsibility, is smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "291. TRAVELING SALESMAN.--In some houses a traveling salesman is allowed\n",
      "a standing commission on all goods bought by firms whose custom was\n",
      "secured through his influence. As the commission continues as long as\n",
      "the customer continues the trade at that house, some agents, after a few\n",
      "years of active work are enabled to retire on incomes of $2,000, $3,000,\n",
      "and in some cases of $5,000 a year. The business done by drummers is\n",
      "immense. Three hundred million tons of goods are shipped by them yearly,\n",
      "and the business amounts to nearly $2,000,000 a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "292. SUPPLY COMPANIES.--A supply company differs from an ordinary\n",
      "merchants’ firm in that it does not keep goods in stock. It is a mammoth\n",
      "general agency for procuring whatsoever you desire. Specimens only are\n",
      "kept in the store, and from these the customers make selections. The\n",
      "advantage of supply companies is the saving of large rentals, of\n",
      "expensive clerk-hire, and of loss or damage in the long keeping of\n",
      "goods, and, most of all, of risk in unsalable articles, and in the fall\n",
      "of prices. Thus, a supply company can undersell an ordinary dealer, and\n",
      "if alert and prompt can make vast profits. Another great advantage is\n",
      "the smallness of the capital required. Here are great opportunities for\n",
      "bright young business men of limited means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "293. AGENCIES FOR TEACHERS.--The number of teachers in the public\n",
      "schools in the United States is 400,325. The matter of engaging school\n",
      "teachers varies in different States, and often in different parts of\n",
      "the same State. Sometimes it is done by county superintendents, often\n",
      "by the Board of Education, but most frequently by the school trustees,\n",
      "commissioners, or committees. One going into the business of a Teachers’\n",
      "Agency must ascertain the particular method in every part of the\n",
      "country, and learn the name of the persons authorized to act in that\n",
      "capacity. Then he should issue circulars by the hundred thousand. For\n",
      "the eyes of applicants, he should use the advertising pages of the\n",
      "newspapers. Teachers should be charged a commission upon their salaries\n",
      "in something like the following order: Five per cent. on first year’s\n",
      "salary, three per cent. the second year, and one per cent. the third\n",
      "year. After that it may be allowed to lapse. The contract should be\n",
      "rigorously drawn, and, where possible, payments should be collected in\n",
      "advance. There are great profits in the business when systematically and\n",
      "vigorously conducted. One agency in the eastern part of the United\n",
      "States is receiving commissions from ten thousand school teachers. Owing\n",
      "to frequent changes, the majority of these are paying five per cent.;\n",
      "but if we suppose the average to be only the amount payable the second\n",
      "year--$3 commission--the income would be $30,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "294. CLERICAL AGENCY.--Here is an opportunity for an unoccupied\n",
      "clergyman of wide clerical acquaintance. There are thousands of vacant\n",
      "pulpits and other thousands of ministers anxious for calls. Establish an\n",
      "agency through whose medium the supply shall meet the demand. Your list\n",
      "should comprise the names of all churchless pastors, together with those\n",
      "desirous of change; and their experience, qualifications, education,\n",
      "family, age, personal appearance, together with other interesting\n",
      "information, should be properly tabulated for the inspection of church\n",
      "committees. Candidates should be graded according to the catalogue, and\n",
      "sent out in order as pulpit candidates. As clerical engagements are\n",
      "commonly much longer than those of teachers, it is right that you should\n",
      "receive a larger per cent. for your services. If a church pays its\n",
      "pastor a salary of $10,000, and you are successful in the search for an\n",
      "available man for its pulpit, it would hardly be a presumption for you\n",
      "to charge $500 for your services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "295. MATRIMONIAL AGENCIES.--These should be conducted with the greatest\n",
      "care, and only by the most conscientious persons, on account of the\n",
      "great responsibilities involved. They are, however, capable of vast\n",
      "development, and of immense good. In Massachusetts alone there are\n",
      "seventy thousand females in excess of the males, while in Illinois the\n",
      "men preponderate to the number of fifty thousand. Your task of bringing\n",
      "together the unmated is a most delicate one, and you should accordingly\n",
      "be well compensated. Where there is much wealth on either side, your\n",
      "commission may be expressed in three figures, and even in four. One\n",
      "thousand dollars is a small sum for a man to pay who secures an\n",
      "accomplished wife and a happy home. We have known several marriages made\n",
      "in this way to turn out exceedingly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "296. AGENCY FOR SERVANTS.--This is not new, but you might revolutionize\n",
      "it by a new plan. Written recommendations are worthless, because almost\n",
      "every one will compensate the disappointment of the discharged servant\n",
      "by a certificate of good behavior, in the writing of which the\n",
      "elasticity of the conscience is more or less drawn upon. Instead of\n",
      "accepting a valueless paper, let an employee of the office personally\n",
      "visit two or three of the places where the servant has been employed.\n",
      "The lady of the house will tell you many things she would not write in\n",
      "the letter. This will consume time, but the compensation is in the\n",
      "better class of service you will be enabled to offer. When it is known\n",
      "that you make personal investigation, sifting out the useless and\n",
      "offering only first-class help, your patronage will be vastly increased,\n",
      "and you can charge much higher commissions. Tell your patron that at the\n",

      "and millions of “cures” are sold annually. The names of some of these,\n",
      "such as Hostetter, Brandreth, and Mother Winslow, have become household\n",

      "The story is told of one credulous hypochondriac, who, on the theory\n",
      "that of many shot some one is likely to hit, actually took every kind of\n",
      "patent medicine in the world, or at least of every sort he had heard\n",
      "about. As there are more than three hundred and sixty diverse\n",
      "concoctions, this genius must have taken a different kind for every day\n",
      "of the year, or else have extended his experiments through a long\n",
      "period, which seems impossible under the circumstances. It is said that\n",
      "Perry Davis obtained his famous “Discovery” in the form of a recipe in\n",
      "an old newspaper which he found in an outhouse. This was the foundation\n",
      "of one of the largest fortunes in patent medicines, and it was the\n",

      "the rate of taxes of various kinds, imposed or likely to be imposed upon\n",
      "the property. Tax methods in large cities are often ways that are dark.\n",
      "For this reason, George Gould, the multi-millionaire, and Mr.\n",

      "properties.\n",

      "321. CITY PROPERTY.--A mile and a half of millionaires! Midway between\n",
      "the East River and the Hudson there lay a few years ago a neglected\n",
      "tract of land which could have been bought for a few hundred thousand\n",
      "dollars. To-day it is the wealthiest mile and a half on the Western\n",
      "continent. One hundred million dollars would not purchase the ground\n",
      "alone. Forty years ago a piece of land which is now almost “down-town”\n",
      "was called “Eno’s Folly,” because he paid for it what was supposed to be\n",
      "an extravagant sum. It is now the site of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. The\n",

      "owners by inquiring the price of what was supposed to be worthless land.\n",
      "They, thinking him crazy or a fool, named a thousand dollars, or five\n",

      "countryman’s “folly” has been repeated many times since. The owner of\n",
      "Bergen Beach has made a fortune in this way during the last two or three\n",
      "years. As cities grow, pleasure resorts must be found. Buy a bit of\n",
      "seashore and make it into a Bergen Beach or a Bowery Bay. Or, purchase a\n",
      "grove within easy distance of the city, and make it into a pleasure\n",
      "park. In either case, railroads or trolley connection is indispensable,\n",

      "sagacity to see a potential factor in the meeting of two rivers, or the\n",
      "projection of a railroad. The question for investors in real estate is,\n",
      "“Where is the population going?” Keen observers note the drift, get\n",
      "ahead of the tide, and are ready to sell lots when the people arrive.\n",
      "Whitestone and Morris Park on Long Island were built in this way. It is\n",

      "handsomely where the projector is fortunate in his location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "324. WESTERN LANDS.--Fortunes have been made and lost in Western lands.\n",
      "The facts are that some sharpers have been booming lands that are hardly\n",
      "worth the taxes. Persons who have bought “corner lots” in “promising”\n",
      "Western towns have been surprised to learn that the towns were not\n",
      "built, or even surveyed, and that often the site was located in the\n",
      "midst of an impenetrable swamp where a town was impossible. However,\n",
      "lands along the line of railroads, or places which have harbor\n",
      "facilities on the banks of rivers are good investments.\n",

      "325. THE APARTMENT HOUSE.--The apartment house, which is a kind of\n",
      "evolution of the flat, is becoming a feature of life in large cities.\n",
      "The question whether it is a paying property will receive light by the\n",
      "consideration of the rents received by the owners of a building of this\n",
      "kind in New York, the Knickerbocker at Fifth Avenue and Twenty-eighth\n",
      "Street. This is a typical apartment house, and the tenants may almost be\n",

      "command $1,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "326. THE SKY SCRAPER.--There is no limit to the extent of a building in\n",
      "height. Some are twenty stories, one is thirty, and it is reported that\n",
      "a sky-scraper fifty stories in height is projected. Do they pay? Here is\n",
      "the account of a modest one of only nine stories, the Mills Building on\n",
      "William Street, New York. The cost, with land, was $2,500,000. It is 175\n",
      "× 150 feet. It contains 400 offices, has 1,200 tenants, and pays an\n",
      "annual net rental of $200,000, or eight per cent. It is related of Mr.\n",
      "D. O. Mills, the owner, that in completing his magnificent residence on\n",
      "upper Fifth Avenue, he gave a _carte blanche_ order to a decorator, and\n",
      "departed with his family to California. On returning he was delighted to\n",
      "find the place transformed into an Aladdin’s Palace, but his joy was\n",

      "$450,000.\n",

      "\n",
      "327. THE JERSEY FLATS.--Right over against property whose taxable value\n",
      "is $3,000,000,000 lies another property worth literally nothing. Step\n",
      "over from Manhattan Island, where every foot of land needs to be\n",
      "overlaid with silver round-moons for its purchase, to New Jersey, and\n",
      "you will find 27,000 acres of marsh lying under the very nose of the\n",

      "329. CRAYON WORK.--A teacher in the Cooper Institute says: “During the\n",
      "previous year forty of my pupils in art have made $7,000, or $175 each,\n",
      "while learning the art of crayon-photography. Every year one hundred\n",

      "house to thank me for what she had learned at the Institute.” “I have\n",
      "earned $300 coloring photographs,” she said with enthusiasm. The\n",

      "332. OIL PAINTING.--A man in middle life met Mr. Cooper on the stairs of\n",
      "the Institute. “My daughter,” he said, “makes $1,300 a year by teaching\n",
      "painting, and I never earned more than $1,200 myself.” The chief points\n",
      "of oil painting are a _good tooth_ (a canvas which will take color from\n",
      "a brush readily), perspective, fineness of touch, delicate perception,\n",
      "an eye for shades of color, and a bold, free hand. Oil paintings bring\n",
      "from $5 to $50,000, according to merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "333. WATER COLORS.--Paintings in water colors are popular because less\n",
      "expensive than those done in oil. Good work in this department is,\n",
      "however, well paid. Much depends upon the subject and its treatment. It\n",
      "is said that the artist, Mr. John LaFarge, sold about $15,000 worth of\n",
      "water colors last year.\n",

      "rich as a queen. I have thirty pupils in wood engraving.”\n",

      "\n",
      "335. BOOK DECORATION.--Publishers of books, and especially of magazines,\n",
      "pay large prices for decorations for the covers, title pages, and other\n",
      "important parts. The secret of success is in the design. If you can find\n",
      "a happy idea, you will get a large price for it. Of course, the point in\n",
      "most cases is to illustrate the subject-matter. A unique conception,\n",
      "happily worked out, will give both fame and money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "336. DYEING.--This may not be thought one of the fine arts, but it\n",
      "requires a skill hardly inferior to that of the painter or sculptor.\n",
      "There is a large field in the recoloring of tapestries, silks, and\n",
      "woolen goods. The requisites of success are taste, a good eye for color,\n",
      "knowledge of dye-stuffs, and indefatigable industry in finding a market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "337. DESIGNS.--These are constantly in demand. Wall paper manufacturers,\n",
      "dressmakers, architects, builders, home decorators, carpet\n",
      "manufacturers, fine-art workers, all want designs. An ordinary\n",
      "kaleidoscope will furnish you thousands of suggestions every day. From\n",
      "these select a few of the best and work them on a fine, white drawing\n",
      "paper. Have a separate folio for each department of drawings, and\n",
      "advertise what you are doing. If you have a real talent for the work,\n",
      "and a show-window, you cannot fail of success in any large town.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "339. EMBROIDERY.--This is one of the simplest of the arts. The only\n",
      "capital required is a ball of worsted, the only tool a needle, and the\n",
      "only instruction a few elementary rules that can be quickly learned. The\n",
      "demand depends upon the skill. A small store can be cheaply stocked, and\n",
      "its contents sold at a good profit if the articles are unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "340. LACE MAKING.--Our valuable laces are chiefly imported, but there is\n",
      "no reason why work equally good should not be done at home. An immense\n",
      "field yet to be developed is American-made needle-point lace. Get a book\n",
      "on the subject and study it theoretically. Then take lessons of a maker.\n",
      "The book will give you suggestions and enable you, after you have\n",
      "learned the business, to strike out in various directions independently\n",
      "of your teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "341. DRAWING IN CHARCOAL.--This is a rapid, facile, and effective method\n",
      "for sketching. The drawings are more especially in demand in summer\n",
      "cottages, tents, and in whatever places lodgings are temporary, and\n",
      "where lodgers dislike the trouble of shipping costly paintings. You can\n",
      "find a ready market for good work at any mountain or seaside resort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "342. PAINTING ON CHINA.--This is becoming very popular. Few kinds of art\n",
      "pay better than china-firing. The outfit will cost from $15 to $50,\n",
      "according to the size of the kiln, but the pleasure and profit will be\n",
      "worth many hundreds of dollars. If you live in a country town, put your\n",
      "wares in a prominent store, and they will be sure to attract attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "343. PORTRAIT PAINTING.--This is profitable if you can secure sufficient\n",
      "custom. The difficulty is to get the flesh tones, the expression, and\n",
      "the proper degree of illumination. Last year, there were thirty young\n",
      "women in Cooper Institute learning the art, and one-fifth of the number\n",

      "make a new article, or to make an old article by improved means. David\n",
      "Maydole, a village blacksmith, was requested to make for a carpenter a\n",
      "hammer as good as he could make it. He made a better hammer than had\n",
      "ever before been seen, and the carpenter’s mates all wanted one. The\n",
      "village storekeeper ordered two dozen. A hardware dealer, passing\n",
      "through the place to sell his wares, left an order for all the\n",
      "blacksmith could make. The hammer-maker built a large factory, and this\n",
      "was the humble origin of the celebrated Maydole hammer, and the\n",
      "foundation of a great fortune. Another fascinating chapter on\n",
      "manufacture is the “Story of Pullman,” which reads like a fairy tale,\n",
      "but is all strictly true. Mr. Pullman began in a small way to build\n",
      "parlor cars, making one or two as an experiment. The traveling public\n",
      "were quick to appreciate the luxury, and Mr. P. had to enlarge his works\n",
      "again and again. He built the town of Pullman, which is now valued at\n",
      "$30,000,000, and the capital stock which now has a market value of\n",
      "$60,000,000, has paid dividends with the regularity of a government\n",
      "loan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "344. BICYCLE FACTORIES.--These have proved veritable bonanzas during the\n",
      "past few years. In 1878, Col. Albert A. Pike began the manufacture of\n",
      "bicycles, making fifty that year. To-day he has a phenomenal business,\n",
      "employing a capital of $5,000,000 utilizing four factories in Hartford,\n",
      "Conn., and making 600 bicycles a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "345. DOUBLE PROFIT FURS.--Here is a way to make a double profit from the\n",
      "skins of animals: Soak the furs in limewater till the hair is loosened,\n",
      "then wash and hang it up to dry. Lay it on a board with the hair side up\n",
      "and apply a solution of glue, care being taken not to disturb the\n",
      "natural position of the hairs. When the glue is dry and hard, hold the\n",
      "hairs so firmly as to allow the natural skin to be peeled off. Now you\n",
      "can apply the artificial skin by pouring over the hairs liquid\n",
      "India-rubber, boiled drying-oils, or other waterproof substances, which\n",
      "on drying will form a continuous membrane supporting the hairs. The glue\n",
      "is then removed by steeping the fur in warm water. This plan has the\n",
      "double advantage that the fur so prepared is moth-proof, and the old\n",
      "skin can be used for the manufacture of leather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "346. MICA SHEETS.--Large sheets of mica command a great price. There are\n",
      "only a few places where the mineral can be mined in sheets of one foot\n",
      "square or larger, but the vast heaps of waste mica can be utilized by\n",
      "building up the sheets artificially. This can be done by treating it\n",
      "with shellac. There are fortunes in waste mica quarries for those who\n",
      "know how to utilize the countless tons of fragments. The field is\n",
      "especially promising in North Carolina and Georgia, where immense\n",
      "quarries abound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "347. ARTIFICIAL MARBLE.--There is room for profitable investment in the\n",
      "manufacture of any article which is procured from nature at great\n",
      "expense. This is the case with marble. It is scarce at best; the\n",
      "quarries are remote from the centers of population, and the mining and\n",
      "transportation make it a very costly article. Marble can be manufactured\n",
      "by imitating nature’s processes--the percolating of water through chalk.\n",
      "The popular verde antique can be made by an application of an oxide of\n",
      "copper. The slices of marble are then placed in another bath, where they\n",
      "are hardened and crystallized, coming out exactly like the real article.\n",
      "In Italy, a fine black marble is made from common white sandstone. The\n",
      "manufacture is carried on by the owners of the local gasworks, who thus\n",
      "reap a double profit from their plant. Here is a hint for American\n",
      "manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "348. ARTIFICIAL WHALEBONE.--Whalebone is in great demand. It is worth\n",
      "from $3 to $4 per pound. No artificial substance has as yet been found\n",
      "to take its place, but we are surely on the eve of that discovery. No\n",
      "one substance is at the same time so hard and so elastic, but\n",
      "experimenters will yet find a combination which will answer the purpose.\n",
      "One has already been found which draws the surplus demand when the\n",
      "genuine article cannot be obtained. The inventor who can advance another\n",
      "step and produce an exact imitation will have the whalebone market in\n",
      "his hands. This field is rich with possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "P. S.--Since writing the above we have the secret. Here it is: Treat the\n",
      "rawhide with sulphide of sodium, remove the hair, immerse the hide\n",
      "twenty-six to thirty-four hours in a weak solution of double sulphate of\n",
      "potassa, and stretch it upon a frame or table, in order that it may not\n",
      "contract in drying. The desiccation is allowed to proceed in broad\n",
      "daylight, and the hide is then exposed to a temperature of fifty to\n",
      "sixty degrees. The influence of the light, combined with the action of\n",
      "the double sulphate of potassa absorbed by the skin, renders the\n",
      "gelatine insoluble in water, and prevents putrefaction, the moisture\n",
      "being completely expelled. Thus prepared, the skin is submitted to a\n",
      "strong pressure, which gives to it almost the hardness and elasticity\n",
      "which characterize the genuine whalebone, with the advantage that before\n",
      "or after the process of desiccation any color desired may be imparted to\n",
      "it by means of a dye bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "349. ARTIFICIAL INDIA RUBBER.--A man while experimenting recently with\n",
      "cottonseed oil for the production of a varnish, obtained to his\n",
      "surprise, not a varnish, but a rubber. By its use, with fifteen per\n",
      "cent. of genuine rubber, an article can be produced so exactly like the\n",
      "real as to defy detection. The process is so simple that a patent is not\n",
      "obtainable. So, manufacturers, the field is open. Rubber is high and in\n",
      "great demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "350. ARTIFICIAL CAMPHOR.--Here is another trade secret. The genuine\n",
      "camphor is scarce. The artificial is made in England, shipped to\n",
      "Hamburg, and then re-shipped to England as the real article. Here is the\n",
      "way it is made: Pass a current of dry hydrochloric acid gas through\n",
      "spirits of turpentine cooled by a freezing mixture. The liquid deposits\n",
      "crystals, which are dissolved in alcohol and precipitated by water. The\n",
      "separated crystals are drained and dried. They are perfectly colorless,\n",
      "with an odor like camphor. At the ordinary temperature, its vapor\n",
      "tension is sufficient to cause it to sublime like ordinary camphor in\n",
      "small brilliant crystals in the bottles in which it is preserved. It is\n",
      "insoluble in water, and gyrates when on the surface of that liquid like\n",
      "true camphor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "351. CAR BUILDING.--Some day another Pullman will arise, but with\n",
      "developments in car building in a totally different direction. We quote\n",
      "from a recent magazine article: “The time is sure to come when a new\n",
      "railroad genius will arise and make an end of the game of brag between\n",
      "American general passenger agents. This reformer will probably\n",
      "substitute light and easily cleaned bamboo seats for those now in use;\n",
      "he will save a good deal of the money now spent in useless\n",
      "ornamentation, and spend it in better ventilation and lighting; and he\n",
      "is likely to design frames and trucks much lighter, and at least as\n",
      "strong and durable, as those which carry the average day car of the\n",
      "present time. It is possible, too, that he may accomplish a good result\n",
      "by lowering the center of gravity of the prevailing type of passenger\n",
      "car, thus preventing it from rolling at high rates of speed, and\n",
      "obviating the supposed necessity of placing two or three tons of old\n",
      "rails in the floor to keep it steady.” It is perhaps needless to say\n",
      "that such a man as Mr. Pullman or Mr. Wagner will become a\n",
      "multi-millionaire through this much-needed reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "352. THE TRANSVERSE WOODEN PAVEMENT.--One day the celebrated wit,\n",
      "Sidney Smith, was talking with some vestrymen of the church of which he\n",
      "was a member about laying a wooden pavement around the sacred edifice.\n",
      "“Well,” said the famous jester, “we have but to lay our heads together\n",
      "and the thing is done.” But here is a pavement which some capitalists\n",
      "will one day lay their heads (funds) together to produce, and it will be\n",
      "no joke. It has been ascertained that the most durable pavement is made\n",
      "from blocks of wood sawed transversely about twelve inches in thickness.\n",
      "The larger and smaller blocks are fitted together, the smaller\n",

      "yielded 3,000 barrels a day. One of the quickest ways to accumulate a\n",
      "fortune is to prospect for oil, and when a rich vein is struck to buy as\n",
      "much land as you can. A young man named Johnny Steel once owned nearly\n",
      "all the land where the Pennsylvania oil wells were discovered. His\n",
      "income was over $1,000,000 a year, $30,000 a day, or about $2 a minute.\n",
      "But, verifying the adage that “a fool and his money are soon parted,” he\n",
      "not only spent all this enormous income, but also squandered the entire\n",

      "mammoth fortunes, has often consisted in little more than the set of\n",
      "stools and the cost of the patent. Of course, there must be brains and\n",
      "hard thinking. The sale of articles protected by patent rights is a\n",
      "stimulus to invent them, and has been the source of fortunes for more\n",
      "people in the United States than in any other country in the world. The\n",
      "United States Patent Office issues every year about 25,000 patents, and\n",
      "the number is constantly increasing. Nor are the patentees in all, or\n",
      "even in a majority of cases, men of genius, or persons who have been\n",
      "learned in the occupations in which they have achieved distinction. The\n",
      "greater part of them have been issued to persons in humble walks of\n",
      "life, who made their lucky discovery either by accident or by close\n",
      "application of thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "In every department of human industry there are possibilities of\n",
      "improvement. He who can find a cheaper, quicker, or better, way of doing\n",
      "anything will get rich. Cyrus H. McCormick thought out a better way of\n",
      "cutting grain than with the old scythe. The result was the McCormick\n",
      "harvester, known all over the world. His patents made him a millionaire.\n",
      "Charles Goodyear accidentally mixed a bit of rubber and sulphur on a red\n",
      "hot stove. The result set him to thinking. He discovered the process of\n",
      "vulcanization, which is the basis of the great rubber industry\n",
      "throughout the world. His patents made him enormously rich. Elias Howe\n",
      "wondered if there could not be some better way of sewing than by the\n",
      "bone and muscle of weary woman’s hand. He tried and tried in vain. At\n",
      "last he had a dream in which he saw a needle with the eye at the point\n",
      "instead of at the head. He awoke exclaiming, “I have it!” The result was\n",
      "the sewing machine. Mr. Howe received every year more than $100,000\n",
      "royalties on his patent needle. Eli Whitney, watching some slaves\n",
      "cleaning cotton, set to work to find a better way. He invented the\n",
      "cotton-gin by which one machine performs the labor of five thousand\n",
      "persons. This invention reaped for him untold wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were men of genius, but there are inventions which, being simple,\n",
      "lie apparently within the reach of all men. Mr. Parker, whose invention\n",
      "of the tobacco box fastening, is nothing but a “bulge and a dent,” and\n",
      "which it would seem any child might have thought out, made an immense\n",
      "fortune. Another inventor obtained a patent for a washing machine, and\n",
      "sold it in about fifteen months for $50,000. A man obtained a patent for\n",
      "a windmill, took a model through the Western States, and in eight months\n",
      "returned with $40,000 in cash. Probably the simplest device of all which\n",
      "has afforded amusement for millions is the game of the “Donkey Party,”\n",
      "which is nothing more than the picture of a tailless donkey placed upon\n",
      "the wall. The game costs less than one cent, but millions are annually\n",
      "sold. A copyright costing $5 insured this windfall to the inventor. The\n",
      "“Parlor Target and Dot” patent brought $35,000. The chief examiner of\n",
      "the Patent Office says: “A patent, if it is worth anything, when\n",
      "properly managed, is worth and can easily be sold for from $10,000 to\n",
      "$50,000.”\n",

      "According to an estimate by the Commissioner of Patents seven-eighths of\n",
      "the manufacturing capital of the United States, or upwards of\n",
      "$600,000,000 is based upon patents, either directly or indirectly. A\n",
      "very large proportion of all patents prove remunerative; this is the\n",
      "reason so many are applied for, and so many millions of capital invested\n",
      "in their workings. There is scarcely an article for amusement,\n",
      "convenience, or necessity, in use to-day that has not at some time or\n",
      "other been the subject of a patent either in whole or in part. The sale\n",
      "of every such article yields the inventor a profit. If we purchase a box\n",
      "of matches a portion of the price goes to the inventor; if we buy a\n",

      "There are gold mines in every walk in life. There are fortunes hid in\n",
      "the smallest and meanest of things. So far from the field being\n",
      "exhausted, more inventions are now being patented than ever before. The\n",
      "world is inexhaustibly full of nuggets for him who can find them. Every\n",

      "cartage. One which could be worked on the inside by a button on the\n",
      "outside is demanded. Improvements in faucets have made two or three\n",
      "inventors rich, but the right one is yet to come.\n",

      "and make money for the patentee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "523. GOODS EXHIBITOR.--On an upright column attach a number of steel or\n",

      "pierce the fruit, and making a hole just large enough for the juice to\n",
      "be extracted by the squeezer, but not large enough for the pulp to\n",
      "escape. The only squeezer which presses the lemon without cutting it in\n",
      "half. The inventor of the glass lemon squeezer made a large fortune.\n",

      "\n",
      "530. FISHERMAN’S CLAW.--A large, steel claw somewhat on the principle of\n",
      "a net, but with many advantages, might be invented. The claw when opened\n",
      "should cover three or four square yards of water. It closes with a\n",
      "spring attached to the handle. Quite as much sport in this as with the\n",
      "hook and line. The right article ought to have great sales.\n",

      "children’s money a bank with a device attached for registering the\n",
      "amount which it contains. A cheap device of this kind would be a great\n",
      "improvement on the present toy bank. The inventor of one of the\n",
      "principal banks for children now in use is said to have made half a\n",
      "million dollars out of his invention.\n",

      "paper and using it for a lighter could be utilized by an inventor in the\n",
      "manufacture of matches,” says the _National Druggist_. “The invention\n",
      "would revolutionize match manufacturing, because the wood for this\n",
      "purpose is constantly growing scarcer and more costly. The matches would\n",
      "be considerably cheaper than the wooden ones, and also weigh less, a\n",
      "fact which counts for much in the exportation.”\n",

      "to put the inventor on the high road to fortune. Why could not our\n",
      "newspaper-type, by the use of phosphorous, after the manner of the\n",

      "glass, its many other advantages would make it an El Dorado for the\n",
      "inventor. Its lightness in transportation and its freedom from breakage\n",
      "would cause it to come into general use. Especially on shipboard, where\n",
      "bottles are constantly broken by the roll of the vessel, would such an\n",
      "invention be hailed with joy.\n",

      "536. THE PAPER SAIL.--“Paper sails,” says the _Railway Review_, “are\n",
      "meeting with considerable favor. They are cheaper than canvas sails,\n",
      "and they are soft, flexible, and as untearable as the original article.”\n",
      "There is room for invention here. Treated with the proper solutions, it\n",

      "This will prevent the fowls from getting their feet in the water and\n",
      "fouling it, while at the same time the cone is a reservoir of supply.\n",

      "beyond the first investment. Small trees before transplanting may be set\n",
      "one foot apart, and hence an acre will hold about forty-four thousand.\n",
      "At nine cents apiece--the average price--this means $3,960. Deduct for\n",
      "labor and expressage. The success of the tree merchant depends almost\n",
      "solely on his finding a market.\n",

      "725. ROUND NUMBER ONIONS.--The round number of one thousand bushels to\n",
      "the acre has been done, and can be done under favorable circumstances.\n",
      "In a certain district in Fairfield County, Conn., nearly all the men are\n",
      "well-to-do farmers. Ask them the secret of their success and the one\n",
      "reply will be “onions.” Here, surely, even in rocky Connecticut, farming\n",
      "pays. They get from seventy-five cents to $1.25 per bushel. The crop is\n",
      "not always a safe one, dependent upon weather conditions; but, taken one\n",
      "year with another, the farmers do well, and steadily add to their bank\n",
      "account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "726. POTATO PROFITS.--Let us see what can be done with potatoes. In a\n",
      "prize contest recently the average per acre was 465 bushels. The highest\n",
      "was 975 bushels. The price per bushel was from sixty to sixty-six cents.\n",
      "The next profit was on the average $260 per acre and in case of the\n",
      "highest was about $500. Of course this is vastly above what is\n",
      "accomplished by the ordinary farmer, but it shows what can be done with\n",
      "good soil, liberal dressing, prolific variety, and thorough tillage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "727. GOLDEN GEESE.--Here is one man’s experience: “I bought a gander and\n",
      "three geese. From the geese I received yearly forty eggs each in two\n",
      "litters, or a total of 120. I find that from this number of eggs I can\n",
      "safely count on seventy-five per cent of matured chicks, or ninety\n",
      "goslings. The weight when fatted is 855 pounds, and at twenty cents a\n",
      "pound I receive $171. Cost of keeping is $46. Profits, $125. Of course,\n",
      "the sum varies one year from another, but this is my average for five\n",
      "years.” At the same rate the goslings from 100 geese would pay a net\n",
      "profit of $4,125, but if they paid only one-quarter that sum it would\n",
      "still be a profitable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "728. CALIFORNIA PRUNES.--This great state has now 85,000 acres planted\n",
      "with prunes, and produced last year 65,000,000 pounds. The crop has\n",
      "grown from nothing to this enormous amount in the last few years. People\n",
      "do not rush into an enterprise in this way unless they are pretty sure\n",
      "it is a good thing. The “good thing” in this case is that prunes costing\n",
      "one and one half cents per pound to raise sell for six and seven cents,\n",
      "and the prune raisers are all getting rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "729. A BEE FARM.--Here is another California bonanza. Says a man in the\n",
      "southern part of the State: “Last year I marketed ten tons of extracted\n",
      "honey, and three tons of comb honey, all from 154 colonies. I received\n",
      "on an average ten cents per pound, or a total of $3,600. The space\n",
      "employed was 1,386 feet, or somewhat less than an acre.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "730. THE APPLE ACRE.--A man in New England said that after forty years\n",
      "experience, raising all kinds of crops, he found that his apple orchard\n",
      "averaged $55 per acre, which was better than any crop on his other 200\n",
      "acres of land.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "731. THE SUGAR BEET.--Purchase a farm within a few miles of a sugar beet\n",
      "factory. With proper cultivation you can grow nine tons to the acre, and\n",
      "the factory price should be $4.50 per ton. The thriftiness of the beet\n",
      "makes little trouble with weeds, and hence the expense of raising is not\n",
      "one-fourth that of onions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "732. GILT-EDGED BREEDS.--The sum of $5,100 was recently paid for a\n",
      "Poland-China boar. A litter of pigs of this breed brought $3,500. These\n",
      "sums seem almost incredible, but when people have both the mania and the\n",
      "money they will pay any amount to gratify their taste. There are persons\n",
      "who take as much pride in pigs as others do in horses. The best way to\n",
      "succeed with new breeds is to cultivate a strain for yourself. It\n",
      "requires time, patience and experience, and some outlay in risk, but in\n",
      "the end it pays, especially if one has the gift of knowing how to\n",
      "trumpet his stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "733. DECEMBER LAYERS.--With a trifling expense you can have eggs at\n",
      "Christmas as well as at Easter. The price is often more than double at\n",
      "the former season. Connect with hot water-pipes and keep your hens warm.\n",
      "A cold hen never lays an egg. A poultry expert says if a flock is well\n",
      "cared for the whole year round, it should pay annually for each hen $1\n",
      "net. At the same rate a flock of four hundred would bring a net income\n",
      "of $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "734. FLORIDA CELERY.--In Florida the first growers made from $500 to\n",
      "$1,500 per acre. Competition has reduced the price, but at present rates\n",
      "men with six acres are getting a comfortable support, and those who have\n",
      "the means to cultivate a large farm of this popular vegetable are\n",
      "rapidly growing rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "735. ONEIDA HOPS.--It takes a good many hops to weigh a pound, but\n",
      "growers in Oneida County, New York, have raised 1,400 pounds per acre,\n",
      "receiving therefor $112. Probably this is somewhat better than the\n",
      "average, but profits in even low-price years are better in that section\n",
      "of the country than for any other crop. Hops are a safe and easy crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "736. BOSTON BEANS.--They are not raised in Boston--only baked there.\n",
      "They are a hardy crop, and will grow on any properly cultivated soil.\n",
      "One year with another they bring $2.50 per bushel. Beans are the surest\n",
      "of all crops, and if the price were only as certain, you could figure\n",
      "out your income in advance almost as accurately as if employed on a\n",
      "salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "737. CHRISTMAS TREES.--Buy for a few hundred dollars an abandoned farm\n",
      "too poor for culture, and pack it with small evergreens. Christmas trees\n",
      "command from fifty cents to $5, and you can grow a thousand of them on a\n",
      "single acre. There are fortunes in what is called worthless land if you\n",
      "know how to improve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "738. THE GUARANTEED EGG.--A great business can be done with a guaranteed\n",
      "egg. Success depends upon the absolute perfection of your egg. Have a\n",
      "stamp made, and stamp every egg with the name of your farm, and offer to\n",
      "replace any one found faulty. Also stamp the date on which they are\n",
      "taken from the nest. In this way you will absolutely protect your\n",
      "product from the frauds of dealers, your eggs will attain a wide\n",
      "reputation, will have an unlimited demand, and you will grow rich. There\n",
      "is a mine of gold in this suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "739. DOUBLE VEGETABLE CULTURE.--Here is an idea of a New Jersey farmer.\n",
      "He has conceived the notion of grafting tomatoes on potatoes vines, or\n",
      "an air crop on a root crop, and thus raising vegetables at both ends.\n",
      "There is nothing impracticable in the notion, and it is doubtless\n",
      "entirely feasible, if only he is liberal enough with his fertilizers.\n",
      "This is an idea for growers who have only a limited space, and where\n",
      "land is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "740. ENGLISH SHIRES.--Colts from Lord Rothschild’s stud farm last year\n",
      "averaged $875. It costs little more to keep a good horse than a poor\n",
      "one. There are great possibilities in the raising of fine-blooded\n",
      "horses. The colt that won the great Futurity race this year could have\n",
      "been easily bought for $700 before the race. Now $20,000 will not\n",
      "purchase him. “Plunger” Walton made $350,000 in two years on the turf.\n",
      "At the Elmendorf stud farm near Lexington, Ky., a short time ago\n",
      "thirty-three yearling colts were sold at prices ranging from $150 to\n",
      "$5,100, the average price being $1,460.87 per head; at the same time\n",
      "twenty yearling fillies brought an average of $676.50 per head, the\n",
      "forty-three yearling colts and fillies being the product of one breeding\n",
      "farm and selling in one day for $47,130 or an average of $1,095.80 per\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "741. FORTUNES IN NUT SHELLS.--Land too poor for meadow or even for\n",
      "pasture may be utilized for nut-growing. The trees require little\n",
      "attention, but will produce bushels of nuts if the soil is properly\n",
      "stirred and fertilized every year. One man in Connecticut raises each\n",
      "year 100 bushels of hickory nuts from ten trees, and sells them at $2 a\n",
      "bushel. The rocky, waste lands of New England can grow millions of these\n",
      "trees. Chestnuts can be grown cheaper than wheat. The standard price is\n",
      "$4 to $8 per bushel, but large chestnuts, early in the season, that is,\n",
      "in September and October, bring from $10 to $15 per bushel. Judge Salt,\n",
      "of Burlington, N. J., says he has a chestnut tree in the middle of a\n",
      "wheat field that pays more than the wheat. The average is about $19 per\n",
      "tree, and twenty trees have ample room in an acre. This makes $300 per\n",
      "acre with but little cost for cultivation. Here is something of\n",
      "importance about the pecan. The chief pomologist at Washington, D. C.,\n",
      "says: “The cultivation of nuts will soon be one of the greatest and most\n",
      "profitable industries in the United States, and there is no use in\n",
      "denying the fact that the Texas soft shell pecan is the favorite nut of\n",
      "the world.” The average yield of these nuts in North Carolina is $300 to\n",
      "$500 per acre. Some pecan trees in New Jersey are producing annually\n",
      "five to six bushels of delicious, thin-shelled nuts.\n",

      "and in another $175 demanded. Amelia Barr, the famous novelist, receives\n",
      "$20,000 a year from the sale of her books. There is a great deal of\n",
      "subterranean literature unknown to the critics and the magazine writers,\n",
      "but which, nevertheless, pays handsomely. One Richebourg, of Paris, has\n",
      "4,000,000 readers, and often receives $12,000 for the serial rights\n",
      "alone, yet he is unknown to the magazine public. In this country the\n",

      "\n",

      "742. THE POPULAR NOVEL.--This is the best paying form of literature. The\n",
      "pen that can touch the popular heart may not be a gold one, but it will\n",
      "bring gold into the pockets of him who wields it. Amelie Rives received\n",
      "$6,000 for “According to St. John.” Lord Lytton received $7,500 for some\n",
      "of his novels. Of the “Heavenly Twins,” 50,000 copies were sold in 1894;\n",
      "of the “Bonny Brier Bush,” 30,000 in five months; and of the “Manxman”\n",

      "1,000,000 copies. In France, there are sold every year of Feuilleton’s\n",
      "works, 50,000; of Daudet’s, 80,000, and of Zola’s, 90,000. Hall Caine\n",
      "received outright a check for $50,000 for “The Christian.” He had struck\n",
      "the popular chord with the “Deemster.” There was almost a pilgrimage of\n",

      "743. THE SHORT STORY.--The short story is very popular in this country,\n",
      "and has attained a perfection reached nowhere else in the world. The\n",
      "rules of success in this department are briefly these: First, to be\n",
      "strikingly original; second, to write simply and naturally; and third,\n",
      "to condense into the smallest compass. Be brief. This is the age of\n",
      "electricity. Many a story of 10,000 words has been rejected when if it\n",
      "had contained half that number it would have been accepted. Publishers\n",
      "pay liberal rates for short, good stories. The New York _Herald_\n",
      "recently paid Mollie E. Seawell $3,000 for a short story. Within a very\n",
      "short time a magazine has offered a price of $1,000 for the best short\n",

      "neighborhood. Any leading newspaper will pay for it if well written. It\n",
      "must be spicy, but not ornate. Put in strong, nervous adjectives; color\n",

      "book which will give them the rules and models of effective speech. A\n",
      "book written with so much care as to make it a kind of standard of\n",

      "755. RACERS’ RECORD BOOK.--A book which should be a reliable record of\n",
      "the fastest times made in horse races, bicycle meets, and sporting\n",
      "matches, ought to have a ready sale. It should consist of condensed\n",
      "tables of all the records of all the great races, interspaced with blank\n",
      "leaves for the jotting down of new records. There are at least a million\n",
      "men interested in racing, and at a very moderate estimate one-quarter\n",

      "latest point of view of hygiene and physiology. Get a symposium of\n",
      "physicians to write on such topics as dress, diet, exercise, sleep,\n",
      "medicine, baths, etc. Most physicians would regard the advertising\n",
      "benefits of these articles as sufficient remuneration, while at the same\n",
      "time their names would help to sell the work, but if necessary pay them\n",
      "for their services. Entitle the work, “Your Own Physician,” and sell it\n",
      "on subscription, the canvasser showing how much cheaper it is to keep\n",
      "well at $2--the price of the book--than to get well at $200--the charge\n",
      "of a physician for services in a long spell of illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "757. THE BOY’S ASTRONOMY.--A small book about the sun, moon and stars,\n",
      "made attractive for beginners. It should teem with illustrations, and\n",
      "the youthful reader should be fascinated as he follows the sun and moon\n",
      "in their courses, learns how eclipses occur, and understands about\n",
      "meteors, comets, and nebulæ. There should also be directions for\n",
      "finding the principal stars on any night of the year. Such a book should\n",
      "command a ready sale, for he who writes for boys and girls has the\n",
      "largest market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "758. RECREATIONS IN CHEMISTRY.--A bishop of the Methodist Episcopal\n",
      "Church once wrote a book entitled “Recreations in Astronomy,” which has\n",
      "had a very large sale. But there is just as much room for “Recreations\n",
      "in Chemistry,” if written with as much imagination and skill. It should\n",
      "contain such fascinating chapters as “Chemistry of a Candle,” “The\n",
      "Dynamics of a Dewdrop,” “The Evolution of an Oak.” The chief points in\n",
      "the authorship should be accuracy and a charming style.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "759. THE CURIOSITY BOOK.--A book packed with the curious things in every\n",
      "department of human research. People like to read about the rare and the\n",
      "curious. A hundred chapters, short, spicy, and containing each a few\n",
      "wonderful things in a special field of learning, would be very popular\n",
      "with both young and old. As a gift book it would be unexcelled. There is\n",
      "money in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "760. THE CHILD’S BIBLE.--A Bible which shall contain the numerous\n",
      "stories so connected in narrative form as to make a continuous history\n",
      "from beginning to end. It should be very simple, and in no way do\n",
      "violence to the sacred record. If properly written, this book could be\n",
      "sold by canvassers in almost every home, and should bring much gain to\n",
      "the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "761. GUIDE TO TRADES.--A complete guide to all the important\n",
      "professions, occupations, callings and trades. This work should show\n",
      "the opportunities in each trade, the comparative chances of success, the\n",
      "remuneration, and a few simple rules for guidance. It should bristle\n",
      "with facts, and should also give one or two examples in the form of\n",
      "stories--short autobiographies still better--of men who have been\n",
      "successful in each department of work. The advantage of this book is\n",
      "that it has no competitor, covering an entirely new field in authorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "762. THE PLEASURE BOOK.--Here is a unique idea for a book. Let there be\n",
      "three hundred or more sections, one for every week day in the year, and\n",
      "let each section contain a different form of amusement. Books on games,\n",
      "riddles, sports, etc., can be drawn upon for supplies. As you must\n",
      "provide enjoyment for all kinds of weather, it will be well to have a\n",
      "short alternative for rainy days in each section. The amusement should\n",
      "be of the greatest possible variety, from the fox-hunt in the fields to\n",
      "the thimble-hunt in the parlor. As a large number of people have leisure\n",
      "only at night, perhaps a work entitled, “Three Hundred Happy Evenings”\n",
      "would be better than the suggestion above, though it would necessarily\n",
      "have to leave out most outdoor sports. Holidays should have a more\n",
      "elaborate programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "763. THE SOLDIER’S BOOK.--There are 750,000 survivors of our Civil War.\n",
      "It would be too much to publish in one book even the briefest account of\n",
      "each. The work should be published in several parts, a volume to a\n",
      "State. In a State like New York, three lines only could be given to the\n",
      "record of a private, but even for the briefest mention of himself and\n",
      "his comrades nearly all the old soldiers would buy the book. In smaller\n",
      "States more space could be given to each man’s record. Considerable\n",
      "capital would be required in the collecting of facts and records, but\n",
      "the publication of such a work would certainly pay, if accurately\n",
      "written and thoroughly canvassed. We have estimated the cost of\n",
      "collecting the information at twenty-five cents for each soldier. It\n",
      "would be much less in great cities where a large number of men could be\n",
      "seen in one day. Cost for 100,000 soldiers, $25,000. Such is the vanity\n",
      "caused by seeing one’s name in print that the book would sell at least\n",
      "to every second soldier. Fifty thousand copies at $2.50, $125,000.\n",
      "Deduct one-fourth for cost and getting out the book, $31,250. Discount\n",
      "for canvassers at one-third the price of the book, $41,666. Total cost,\n",
      "$72,916. Profits, $51,084 for 50,000 copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "764. BOOK OF STYLE.--A man well versed in books could write a small\n",
      "volume on literary style which could be sold to advantage for $1 per\n",
      "copy. The number of literary men is constantly increasing. More than\n",
      "10,000 young men and women are graduated every year from our colleges.\n",
      "At a very low estimate, 25,000 would want a work of this kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "765. SCIENCE OF COMMON THINGS.--A book of great interest to everybody\n",
      "could be compiled from the vast body of matter contained in the last\n",
      "quarter of a century in such periodicals as the _Popular Science\n",
      "Monthly_, the _Scientific American_, etc. It should contain a number of\n",
      "chapters about the heating and ventilating of dwellings, about clothing\n",
      "and food, about road making and house building, and many other things,\n",
      "and be written in such a fascinating style as to make the work\n",
      "attractive, even to persons who ordinarily take no interest in such\n",
      "discussions. The success of such a book depends entirely upon its style.\n",
      "It is possible to write one containing a fortune for the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "766. POPULAR SONGS.--If you are a musical composer there is another rich\n",
      "field which invites you. Many a man in the making of bars and clefs has\n",
      "braided strands of gold. Daniel Emmett wrote “Dixie,” and it ran like\n",
      "wild fire all over the country. Stephen Foster made a fortune with “Old\n",
      "Folks at Home,” Charles K. Harris wrote “After the Ball.” Its sales were\n",
      "over a million copies, and it made him an independently rich man. H. W.\n",
      "Petrie wrote “I Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard.” Its success was\n",
      "phenomenal, and is likely to prove a bonanza to the author; 50,000\n",
      "copies were sold before they were fairly dry from the press. Edward B.\n",
      "Marks, a young writer of New York, wrote “The Little Lost Child,” which\n",
      "netted him $15,000. Sir Arthur Sullivan received $50,000 for his famous\n",
      "song, “The Lost Chord.” Mr. Balfe got $40,000 for “I Dreamt that I Dwelt\n",
      "in Marble Halls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "767. FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS.--Another very wide field is that of the\n",
      "translation of foreign works. There are vast numbers of foreign works\n",
      "upon which there are no copyrights in this country, and others upon\n",
      "which the copyrights have expired. This is a profitable field and\n",
      "comparatively unworked. Even of such transcendant works as those of\n",
      "George Sand and Balzac only a few have been translated. Publishers pay\n",
      "for translations about the same as royalties on original works. Dryden\n",
      "received $6,000 for his translation of Virgil, and Pope received $40,000\n",
      "for his rendering of the “Iliad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "768. CHILDREN’S STORIES.--There are bags of money in children’s stories.\n",
      "Every child at a certain age wants to read or be read to, and there are\n",
      "seven million of this age in the United States. The stories should be\n",
      "short, bright, simple and original, and the book should contain a number\n",
      "of illustrations. Whoever pleases the children pleases the world. “Alice\n",
      "in Wonderland” brought a fortune to its author, and every year Christmas\n",
      "stories for the children bring much money into the pockets of the\n",
      "writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "769. CONDENSED STORIES.--All the popular and standard fiction of the\n",
      "world could be condensed into a dozen volumes by a master hand. It has\n",
      "never yet been attempted. Some omnivorous reader and ambitious writer\n",
      "may yet try it. He must get the heart of the story--the plot--without\n",
      "regard to side issues, by-plays, or ornamentation. See in how few words\n",
      "you can tell one of the Waverley novels without omitting any of the main\n",
      "features. Then publish the entire series in one volume. It is a new\n",
      "idea, and ought to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "770. THE MANNER BOOK.--How to Act, How to Behave, How to Eat, How to\n",
      "Talk, How to Write Letters, How to Propose--in short, the correct way to\n",
      "get on in life. A book consisting of pert, witty chapters upon good\n",
      "manners ought to make a fast-selling work. Many have been written, but\n",
      "none as yet quite meet the demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "771. THE GEORGE REPUBLIC.--Something entirely new. Do you know that in\n",
      "the village of Freeville, Tompkins County, New York, there is a republic\n",
      "composed of many hundred persons ruled entirely by boys, and these the\n",
      "worst of boys, taken mostly from the slums of our cities, a class which\n",
      "could not be governed in the ordinary way? It is hardly too much to say\n",
      "that it is the most suggestive experiment in self-government in all\n",
      "history, and it awaits the pen of a practiced writer. The movement is\n",
      "doubtless to be permanent and popular, and the first one to pen it in\n",
      "graphic style will doubtless gather a good harvest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "772. ONE THOUSAND TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.--Here is a capital idea!\n",
      "Many sea captains have crossed the ocean as many times as that. Get an\n",
      "Atlantic veteran to tell you some of the most thrilling stories of his\n",
      "forty years’ sailing. He may not be much of a writer, but you can put\n",
      "the matter into attractive form. For a small compensation, or perhaps\n",
      "for the love of the thing, he would tell you many exciting tales of the\n",
      "sea. The title is taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "773. THE MAN HUNTER.--Few writings are more fascinating than detective\n",
      "stories, and no one has more interesting matter to relate than one of\n",
      "the sleuths of the law. Think of “Sherlock Holmes,” whom Conan Doyle\n",
      "created, and who has made piles of money for his author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "774. STORY OF A RAGPICKER.--It is a new idea. Did a ragpicker ever write\n",
      "before? But he must have had many interesting experiences. Transfer the\n",
      "stories from his tongue to your pen. Paste these uncouth patches into a\n",
      "literary crazy-quilt as an experienced writer knows how to do, and you\n",
      "will have a book whose title will advertise it, and whose unique\n",
      "contents will make it sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "775. STORY OF A DIVER.--Under the ocean! Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand\n",
      "Leagues Under the Sea” actualized! No one can have more thrilling\n",
      "experiences than a diver. Catch the homely words from his lips, gild\n",
      "them with a lively imagination, color them with an expert pen, and you\n",
      "have a book whose sales will astonish you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "776. STORY OF A CONVICT.--Here is another new idea. The under side of\n",
      "life is seldom if ever told. Who knows what the convict thinks, feels,\n",
      "and suffers? Let a narrative be written from a convict’s point of view.\n",
      "Let him tell how he committed the crime, how he was induced to do it,\n",
      "how he felt when he was doing it, his motives and hopes, the account of\n",
      "his arrest, what his lawyer said to him, his trial, condemnation, and\n",
      "sentence. Then his long imprisonment. A convict who is a good talker\n",
      "could easily give you material which you could skillfully work up into\n",
      "an attractive book, as novel as it would be interesting. Much of the\n",
      "success of “Les Miserables” was due to the vivid portrayal of the\n",
      "sufferings of Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "777. THE STOWAWAY.--Another unique idea! Stowaways are constantly\n",
      "crossing the ocean. Get his story. Tell pathetically his motives for\n",
      "crossing the water, and the account of his privations on shipboard. Here\n",
      "is matter for another Robinson Crusoe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "778. WHEEL AND WORLD.--“Across the Continent on a Bicycle!” “Around the\n",
      "World on a Wheel!” These are attractive titles. All wheelmen--there are\n",
      "300,000 in New York alone--would read it. If you have not made the\n",
      "journey yourself, get some one who has, for a small sum, to tell you the\n",
      "story.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "779. STORY OF A FIREMAN.--A fireman dwells in the midst of alarms. A\n",
      "veteran fireman has been to thousands of fires. Let him tell you twenty\n",
      "or thirty of them in his own way, the thrilling adventures, the\n",
      "hairbreadth escapes, the heroic rescues, and the magnificent and\n",
      "appalling scenes. Every fireman would buy the book, and, if well\n",
      "written, all the fireman’s friends, which means about everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "780. IN A BALLOON.--Here is a most attractive field which has never been\n",
      "occupied. Edgar Poe’s “Journey to the Moon” is celebrated, but it is\n",
      "only a phantasy, while we may have an equally interesting reality--not\n",
      "indeed of a journey to the moon, but through the clouds. If the\n",
      "narrative could be combined with a romance, this might be made the book\n",
      "of the day, which, of course, means many thousands of dollars in the\n",
      "pockets of the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "781. STORY OF AN ENGINEER.--Another man whose life is worth relating is\n",
      "that of an old engineer. Fill the book with an account of his wonderful\n",
      "runs and his thrilling adventures on frontier roads. Of course, there\n",
      "must be horrible accidents, daring “hold-ups,” bold train robberies,\n",
      "stalling in snowbanks, fleeing from prairie fires, and racing with\n",
      "engines of rival roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "782. STORY OF A MURDERER.--Let the criminal give his version of the\n",
      "affair. Not every murderer has a story, or is willing to tell it; but\n",
      "out of hundreds of convicts you should be able to weave a tale as lurid\n",
      "as Blackbeard among the pirates or Bluebeard among the fairies. If it be\n",
      "a recent and celebrated case which has cut a large figure in the\n",
      "newspapers, so much the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "783. STORY OF A TRAMP.--New interest is being taken in this erratic and\n",
      "omnipresent individual. And the time is ripe for a facile pen to\n",
      "portray his vagaries and his wanderings. The “Story of a Tramp” affords\n",
      "an almost unparalleled scope for an author, and there is no phase of\n",
      "civilization which may not be drawn upon to make the story interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "784. STORY OF A LUNATIC.--A very thrilling story, somewhat perhaps after\n",
      "the manner of C. Brockden Brown’s “Weiland,” could be worked up from the\n",
      "ravings of a lunatic. There are a vast number of persons who have wild,\n",
      "harrowing tales. In fact, the audience for such stories is larger than\n",
      "the number of readers of the finer quality of literature. A writer in a\n",
      "recent newspaper says: “The masses do not read the magazines, but they\n",
      "do read sensational literature in the form of dime novels and weekly\n",
      "story papers, and this flashy fiction earns far more money for its\n",
      "writers than is made by more ambitious authors and more pretentious\n",
      "publications.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "785. STORY OF A CRIMINAL LAWYER.--A retired criminal lawyer might make\n",
      "money by the narrative of his most extraordinary cases. If he does not\n",
      "care to write the narrative himself he might in odd moments give it to\n",
      "you. With the pen of a Doyle you might reap that author’s immense\n",
      "royalties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "786. STORY OF THE KLONDIKE.--Many stories of adventure and hardship will\n",
      "doubtless be written about the new land of gold, but the harvest will be\n",
      "reaped by the keen pen of him first in the field. If Alaska has been\n",
      "unkind to you, you may revenge yourself by digging gold from her bowels\n",
      "with the pen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "787. THE EXPOSITION OF FRAUDS.--A very interesting book might be\n",
      "written with this title. Take a few national scandals, like the “Panama\n",
      "Fiasco,” “The South Sea Bubble,” “The Grant-Ward Swindle,” “The\n",
      "Tichborne Claimant.” These subjects when handled with a skillful pen are\n",
      "very interesting to business men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "788. SERMONS OF MODERN PREACHERS.--We have volumes of collected and\n",
      "selected sermons, but no volume which contains various specimens of the\n",
      "preaching of the present day. Have one sermon each from the very newest\n",
      "of pulpit celebrities, such as S. Parkes Cadman, Hugh Price Hughes,\n",
      "Wilbur Chapman, together with one each from such well-known preachers as\n",
      "Phillips Brooks, T. DeWitt Talmage, and Sam Jones. There are over\n",
      "100,000 ordained clergymen in the United States, and at least one-half\n",
      "of them would want this book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "789. THE WONDER BOOK.--A book describing briefly and graphically a few\n",
      "of the great wonders of the world, such as London the greatest city,\n",
      "Niagara the greatest cataract, Monte Carlo the greatest gambling place,\n",
      "while other chapters would be headed, “The Greatest Picture Gallery,”\n",
      "“The Longest Railroad,” “The Tallest Pyramid,” “The Deepest Well,” etc.\n",

      "among all classes.\n",

      "790. HEALTH RESORTS.--Their number is legion. Select a few of the\n",
      "principal in all parts of the country, and write charmingly of their\n",
      "peculiar merits. Especially impress upon your public the specific\n",
      "diseases for which they are beneficial. The 500,000 invalids of the\n",
      "country would want the book.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "791. THE ALL-CURE BOOK.--A book which treats thoroughly the newest\n",
      "systems of cure, such as the Magnetic, Water Cure, Massage, Barefoot,\n",
      "Christian Science, etc., giving a history of the same, and an account of\n",
      "the alleged cures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "792. SUCCESS.--A book for young men. Get twenty business men in\n",
      "different lines to tell you each in a few pages how he was successful.\n",
      "It would be very popular if you could secure as authors such men as John\n",
      "Wanamaker, George Gould (for his deceased father, Jay Gould), James\n",
      "Gordon Bennett, Murat Halstead, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "793. HOW TO SEE NEW YORK.--Not a guide book, but one far more beneficial\n",
      "to strangers who want to see the great metropolis. It should contain at\n",
      "least three sets of directions for persons preparing to visit the city\n",
      "for the first time. These methods and order of sightseeing should be\n",
      "radically different, giving the intending visitor the choice of the\n",
      "three. The million or more people who come every year to New York for\n",

      "year, a total of 1,500 pounds to the acre, and that the fiber would\n",

      "anticipated, but the hopes of the raisers were defeated by the lack of a\n",
      "process for separating it into fine filaments. The slow hand press of\n",

      "States and England depend for their livelihood on the cotton trade.\n",
      "Until recently New England had a monopoly of the cotton manufacture in\n",

      "advantageously in the South. The coal and iron in the mountains and the\n",
      "proximity to the raw product will cause New England soon to be distanced\n",
      "in this important enterprise. For those who seek cotton manufacture for\n",
      "a livelihood or for a competence, and especially for those who are\n",
      "beginning the business, the northern parts of Georgia and Alabama\n",

      "for manuring purposes, and yet thousands of these loads are dumped every\n",
      "day into the water. Instead of the city paying a round sum for the\n",
      "removal of garbage, it ought to receive a bonus from a contractor who\n",
      "knows how to turn it to account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "822. LEAVES.--Rotted leaves form the rich base from which nearly all our\n",
      "forests, and indeed nearly all the vegetation of the earth, springs. The\n",
      "number of loads of leaves that fall from the trees in the autumn are\n",
      "entirely incalculable. The keeper of a country livery stable could add\n",
      "one half to his compost heap, and thus double his sale of fertilizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "823. URBAN SEWAGE.--The best of all fertilizers is allowed to float out\n",
      "to sea and is lost. The Germans are wiser. They utilize all these waste\n",
      "products, and the surprising fertility of the soil near Berlin is the\n",
      "result of this wise employment of nature’s richest fertilizer. There are\n",
      "fortunes for those who will study the foreign system and apply it to the\n",
      "large cities of this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "824. ASHES.--We lose at least $5,000,000 annually in the waste of ashes.\n",
      "In the cultivation of gardens and city lots, where the expense of\n",
      "transportation is small, there is a field for the profitable use of this\n",
      "fertilizer. It could be combined with some product rich in phosphates,\n",
      "as, for example, bone dust, and then put up in barrels for sale. An Ash\n",
      "Fertilizer Company would pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "825. PHOSPHATES.--The phosphate rocks of North Carolina, South Carolina,\n",
      "and Georgia contain fortunes for the men who will develop those\n",
      "industries. The quantity is practically unlimited, and the price of\n",
      "phosphate is $18 a ton. Cheap freights will make these rocks mines of\n",
      "wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "826. COTTONSEED MEAL.--This sells for $20 to $25 a ton, and being a\n",
      "waste product the cost is light. Its sale could be made more general\n",
      "among the farmers if they knew its value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "827. CITY STABLES.--Much of the product of city stables is carried to\n",
      "the country in barges and sold, but more is wasted; especially is this\n",
      "the case with single and small stables in the suburbs, where the\n",
      "accumulation is light, and the law does not require its removal. But a\n",
      "systematic collection of these products would pay any one who should\n",
      "undertake it on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "828. PEAT.--New Jersey has more than 1,000 square miles of peat lands,\n",
      "for the most part undeveloped. The peat is from three to six feet in\n",
      "depth. When phosphates are selling for $18 a ton, there ought to be a\n",
      "market for peat at $5, which would still leave a good margin of profit,\n",
      "if, as seems entirely reasonable, the labor and freightage could be\n",
      "covered for $3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "829. MENHADEN.--The farmers of the eastern end of Long Island have found\n",
      "this an excellent fertilizer. The fish are strewn whole upon the land.\n",
      "More than 1,000,000 of the tiny creatures, or upward of 100 tons, have\n",
      "been caught by one vessel in a single day. The industry is chiefly\n",
      "confined to the vicinity of Gardiner’s Island, but it might be made\n",
      "profitable along other parts of the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "830. FISH SCRAP.--The chemists’ valuation is $41 a ton, but it\n",
      "ordinarily sells for $35 to $38. It is admirably adapted for plant food.\n",
      "One of the largest producers of dry ground fish claims that the farmer\n",
      "gets more for his money in this than in any other fertilizer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "831. SOOT.--For some crops soot is one of the most powerful of all\n",
      "fertilizers, and yet it is allowed to go to waste. The total amount of\n",
      "soot produced in London twenty years ago was 1,100,810 bushels, and is\n",
      "probably about the same for New York to-day. The average price was five\n",
      "cents a bushel, and the total worth $109,165. Probably in this\n",
      "country--at least until its worth is discovered--it could in most cases\n",
      "be obtained free by any one who will take the trouble to pick up this\n",
      "$100,000.\n",

      "Do you realize what an important part advertising plays in trade? The\n",
      "men who succeed are those who let the public know what they have and at\n",
      "what price. The great newspapers contain every day vast mines of\n",
      "advertising matter. There are many merchants who pay over $100,000 a\n",
      "year in letting the public know the cheapness and value of their goods,\n",
      "and one enterprising company, the proprietors of a celebrated baking\n",
      "powder, expend $1,000,000 a year in advertising their product. These\n",
      "merchants are constantly seeking the best means to get their wares\n",
      "before the public eye; also manufacturers, builders, real estate agents,\n",
      "railroad companies, and in fact all persons doing business on a large\n",
      "scale, are seeking to let men know how and what they do. Owners of\n",
      "proprietary medicines have been known to expend $10,000 in a single\n",
      "advertisement in order to secure the attention of ailing people. All\n",
      "these persons will pay you well for any ingenious suggestions whereby\n",
      "they can increase their patronage. The following are some of the methods\n",
      "suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "832. MONEY AND THE MUSE.--Select some liberal advertiser and note what\n",
      "he has to sell or what he has to do, and embody his peculiar merit in a\n",
      "poem. The poem should be short, spicy and humorous, and not be more than\n",
      "eight or ten lines in length. Let it hit off some of the fads of the\n",
      "day. If it be headed by some catch-word of the hour, so much the better.\n",
      "An ingenious person who can write a verse or two of this kind will find\n",
      "a ready market for his muse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "833. CENTS IN NONSENSE.--If you have artistic talent instead of poetic,\n",
      "you can do still better with a drawing. Let the cut be as original and\n",
      "humorous as some of the cartoons in our daily papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "834. WORD PUZZLE.--A puzzle to some minds will be still more effective.\n",
      "Many will be disinclined to use their brains to work it out, but those\n",
      "who do will remember it, and that after all is the merit of an\n",
      "advertisement. A puzzle which may be patented and sold to the advertiser\n",
      "promises much greater profit. See the “Chinese-Get-Off-the-Earth\n",
      "Puzzle.” A puzzle of this kind is commonly sold exclusively to one firm,\n",
      "and ought to bring quite a sum of money to the inventor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "835. TRACKS TO WEALTH.--The inventor who can produce a scheme to cause\n",
      "the customer to become his unconscious advertiser has found the very\n",
      "highroad to success. Such a scheme might be a word in raised letters on\n",
      "the heel of a shoe. Thousands, especially in country towns where there\n",
      "are no sidewalks, would constantly be leaving impressions in the mud,\n",
      "and people would be astonished to find advertisements stamped on the\n",
      "very earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "836. THE STORY ADVERTISEMENT.--Write a short story which ends in an\n",
      "advertisement. This is one of the best methods to gain the reader’s eye.\n",
      "Everybody likes a story, and will read it if it be short. The narrative\n",
      "should lead up gradually and naturally to the advertisement. This\n",
      "requires some ingenuity and skill in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "837. THE FICTITIOUS BANK BILL.--A piece of paper which at first sight\n",
      "looks like a ten-dollar bill, but turns out to be a clever\n",
      "advertisement, would be picked up and read by everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "838. THE POCKETBOOK FIND.--A clever imitation of a pocketbook would be\n",
      "picked up by every pedestrian, and when it is opened with the\n",
      "expectation of money, one finds instead an advertisement of Pluck &\n",
      "Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "839. EVERYBODY’S EAGLE.--A gold (?) eagle with the name of a firm in the\n",
      "place of the usual inscription, will be readily pounced upon, when the\n",
      "lucky finder will learn that “all is not gold that glitters,” but will\n",
      "also learn where and what he can buy to advantage. The firm’s name, of\n",
      "course, is not stamped until the sale of the golden bird is effected.\n",
      "Millions of such eagles could be sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "840. THE WITTY DIALOGUE.--Few things in literature are more attractive\n",
      "than a witty dialogue in which the questions and answers are very short\n",
      "and the denouement is a surprise. If the last word is the magical one of\n",
      "a certain kind of business, such as “Ozone,” “Electrophone,” “----’s\n",
      "Baking Powder,” “----’s Stove Polish,” etc., the maker or merchant will\n",
      "be sure to appreciate it and pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "841. THE STEREOSCOPE BULLETIN.--It pays to give a large sum to the\n",
      "proprietor of a paper who makes a practice of flashing election returns\n",
      "on screens. There is commonly a long wait between the reports, and the\n",
      "vast crowds will meanwhile have nothing to do but study your\n",
      "advertisement flashed between the successive returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "842. THE ARC REFLECTOR.--Have a reflector with an electric light\n",
      "arranged to throw a bright, round light, like the dial of a clock, on\n",
      "the depot platforms, the pavements of crowded streets, or other places\n",
      "where many people congregate. On the background of this strong light let\n",
      "your magic word appear. This is an expensive but very effective way of\n",
      "advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "843. THE LAST SCENE.--Tens of thousands of persons every night are\n",
      "looking upon scenes depicted by the stereoscope. After the “Good Night,”\n",
      "which generally closes the entertainment, immediately, and before the\n",
      "lights are turned on, have your advertisement flashed upon the sheet. As\n",
      "the programme is concluded, the manager would doubtless for a small sum\n",
      "grant a privilege which would be worth many dollars, as no one in the\n",
      "audience can fail to see the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "844. THE RED-LETTER BAT.--For a consideration, the manager of a baseball\n",
      "team would probably let you furnish the players with an excellent bat\n",
      "stamped with your design in large red letters. Your advertisement would\n",
      "flash with every stroke of the bat, and even if many in the crowd were\n",
      "too far away to read the letters, their curiosity would incite them to\n",
      "inquire, and curiosity is the very emotion advertisers seek to arouse.\n",
      "The idea might perhaps be extended to the ball, which is the center of\n",
      "struggle in football matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "845. THE RESTAURANT FAN.--Waiting men will read anything to kill time,\n",
      "but a fan with your enterprise stamped upon it will attract attention,\n",
      "whether one is inclined to read or not. By the hundred thousand these\n",
      "could be produced extremely cheap, and should be presented free to the\n",
      "restaurant keeper. They might also be used in theaters and music halls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "846. THE CIGAR WRAPPER.--It is estimated that 3,000,000 cigars are\n",
      "purchased in New York and vicinity alone every day. For a small sum, say\n",
      "five cents a box, you could doubtless prevail upon most dealers to\n",
      "permit you to wrap each cigar in a piece of paper; especially if the\n",
      "latter were pretty and very attractive, as in the latter case it might\n",
      "even help his sales. The wrapper might contain an alluring picture, but,\n",
      "of course, it contains your advertisement. A small additional sum must\n",
      "be paid a boy for the work of wrapping. As an advertisement, the method\n",
      "would be exceedingly effective, and the idea is certainly a novel one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "847. THE GROWING WORD.--In a reserved space of a daily paper begin with\n",
      "a single glaring letter. Over the letter announce, “Watch this space\n",
      "to-morrow.” The next day another letter is added, and curiosity is\n",
      "excited. If you can get a name for your advertisement similar to the\n",
      "name of a man in the public eye, the success of the scheme is assured.\n",
      "For example, the first letter is G. Is it Grover Cleveland or Garfield?\n",
      "Two letters are given--GA. Is it Garfield or Gage? The third day GAR\n",
      "appears. Is it Garfield or Garland? But in the end it proves to be\n",
      "neither; it is GARLOCK, the name of your invention or brand of goods.\n",
      "Ingenuity can play endlessly upon words in this way, and the curiosity\n",
      "aroused makes it one of the best forms of advertisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "848. THE POLITE STRANGER.--This is a French idea. In Paris a lady is\n",
      "astonished to see a handsome, faultlessly dressed man, generally an\n",
      "elderly person, step directly in front of her, make an extremely polite\n",
      "bow, turn and walk away, when instantly the mystery is solved. On his\n",
      "back appears an advertisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "849. THE FUNNY QUARTETTE.--This also is from Paris, with adaptations.\n",
      "Four odd people--a little, shabbily dressed old woman, a splendidly\n",
      "attired and pompous gentleman, a country youth in blouse and overalls,\n",
      "and a man in the garb of a priest, make up the queerest quartette\n",
      "imaginable. They at once attract attention, but when they begin to sing\n",
      "a crowd gathers instantly. At the conclusion of the song, one says in a\n",
      "loud tone, “Where?” All reply, “At ----.” “When?” “To-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "850. THE STREET BRAWL.--This is on the same line and even more exciting.\n",
      "Readers of “Sherlock Holmes” remember the detective’s ruse to gain\n",
      "entrance to a forbidden house. In the same way, let two men engage in a\n",
      "wordy quarrel. Nothing draws a crowd more quickly than the prospect of a\n",
      "fight. Of course, on a city street the quarrel must not come to actual\n",
      "blows, and the participants must keep an eye open for policemen, but the\n",
      "climax should be the advertisement in the mouth of one or both of the\n",
      "disputants, and the crowd should be dispersed with a hearty laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "851. THE BOX-KITE.--The box-kite presents almost unrivaled opportunities\n",
      "for advertising, and the wonder is that it has not been utilized for\n",
      "that purpose. By a clock-work arrangement and at regular intervals,\n",
      "while the eyes of all are turned skyward, the box releases a host of\n",
      "white leaves, which, floating to the earth, are caught by the crowd.\n",
      "Every leaf contains your advertisement. This method would be especially\n",
      "effective at ball games, horse races, and before election bulletins,\n",
      "while the crowds are waiting for returns or exciting events.\n",

      "the simple discovery of a new force, but its ingenious application, that\n",
      "brings financial reward, and there may be a hundred, or even a thousand\n",
      "ways of applying a new power. These powers are perhaps all known at the\n",
      "present time, but many of them are little utilized, and some have never\n",
      "been harnessed. It is probable that we have as yet only begun to unlock\n",
      "the secrets of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "852. COMPRESSED AIR.--There are vast possibilities in the use of this\n",
      "power. In a few years lightning expresses will fly over the land, swift\n",
      "vessels will skim the deep, monster passenger eagles will soar in the\n",
      "air, and tons of mail matter will be blown through tubes from sea to\n",
      "sea, all driven by this powerful motor, compressed air. These things\n",
      "only wait for money and brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "853. STEAM.--In the application of steam about ninety per cent. of power\n",
      "is lost. This is an enormous waste. Here is room for a second Watt. In\n",
      "the race for primacy as a power, steam need take no second place if only\n",
      "its unutilized forces be turned to account by some inventor. Here is a\n",
      "field worthy of the noblest powers of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "854. ELECTRICITY.--At present electricity sends our telegraph messages,\n",
      "projects our voices through the telephone, propels our street cars,\n",
      "lights our streets and dwellings, and in some States executes our\n",
      "criminals. But it is altogether likely that this as yet comparatively\n",
      "unknown power will be extended into a hundred untried fields. Here is a\n",
      "single example of the economy in its use: The Baldwin Locomotive Company\n",
      "discovered that they were losing eighty per cent. of steam power in\n",
      "shafts and belts. They installed electric motors and reduced the bill\n",
      "for power immensely. Hundreds of large establishments waste from\n",
      "one-fourth to three-fourth of steam in the same way. If electricity can\n",
      "save from $14 to $50 per day, as in the case just quoted, it is surely\n",
      "well worth a trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "855. CALORIC.--The time will come when the billions of cubic feet of\n",
      "sunlight that fall upon our earth will be utilized and will doubtless be\n",
      "the cheapest and most efficient of all the motor forces. If you can only\n",
      "focus this widely distributed energy, you can obtain any amount of heat\n",
      "and consequently power. It has been proved that you can boil two pints\n",
      "of water with the heat of the sun falling upon one and one-half square\n",
      "yards of surface. One square yard of sunshine represents one horse\n",
      "power. The problem, therefore, is to concentrate. This will be done some\n",
      "day by the use of immense convex mirrors. Already experiments are being\n",
      "tried, and the first promoters of this scheme will have the power of the\n",
      "world at their feet and its wealth in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "856. WATER POWER.--The time will also come when the thousands of\n",
      "cataracts and rapids that now waste their energies will all be harnessed\n",
      "and set to work. It is estimated that the water power of Niagara is as\n",
      "great as would be the steam power produced by 226,000,000 tons of coal a\n",
      "year. This one cataract has power enough to make a thousand\n",
      "millionaires, and there are hundreds of smaller waterfalls running to\n",
      "waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "857. WINDMILLS.--Steam is costly and water is not always available, but\n",
      "the wind is everywhere, and costs little or nothing. It has the\n",
      "disadvantage of inconstancy and uncertainty, but it is invaluable for\n",
      "storing up force for future use. The windmill is susceptible of great\n",
      "improvements, and waits for another Morse or Watt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "858. A SAND MILL.--One ingenious man out West has equipped his windmill\n",
      "with an endless belt provided with buckets, like a grain elevator. These\n",
      "dip into a box of dry sand and discharge it upon a large wheel like an\n",
      "overshot water-wheel, which it turns as water would. The sand is\n",
      "discharged again into the box and thus is used over again endlessly. We\n",
      "think the man has not patented his invention; he has missed a fortune\n",
      "which somebody else will pick up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "859. SEA POWER.--Next to the power of the sun is the power of the ocean.\n",
      "An experiment with a dynanometer has shown that the pressure exerted by\n",
      "the sea waves during a storm often exceeds 7,600 pounds per square\n",
      "foot. Multiply this by 1,393,920,000,000,000 feet, which the surface of\n",
      "the ocean presents, and we gather some little notion of the\n",
      "inconceivable power that is running to waste. When will come the\n",
      "inventor who will harness the sea and set it to lighting our cities and\n",
      "carrying men and mail-bags? There is said to be millions upon millions\n",
      "of gold strewn on the ocean’s bed as the result of wrecks, but there is\n",

      "upon the beach.\n",

      "860. ARTESIAN WELL.--The artesian well plant is coming into prominence.\n",
      "Formerly the well was only employed as a means of getting water to\n",
      "drink; it is only recently that it has occurred to people that here is\n",
      "an immense and unused water motor. Water power from running streams is\n",
      "only available here and there, but with the advent of the artesian well\n",
      "there is no spot on earth that may not have as much cheap power as it\n",

      "Here is another opportunity for enterprise and fortune.\n",

      "\n",
      "861. LIQUID AIR.--This is a new discovery, and one very rich in promise.\n",
      "Here is doubtless the long-sought-for method of the storage battery. It\n",
      "has been found that the same force of liquid air as applied in the\n",
      "electric storage battery scores from one-tenth to one-twentieth more\n",
      "than the electric fluid is able to do. Here we have a power whose\n",

      "immense cost and vast number of these buildings, aggregating thousand of\n",
      "millions of dollars, the demand for building materials surpasses all\n",
      "computation and imagination. During the next few decades untold myriads\n",
      "of persons will get rich, either in this discovery of new fields for\n",
      "these materials, exploiting the old ones, or in the invention of new\n",
      "building matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How large is your farm?” inquired a lawyer of a verdant farmer whom he\n",
      "meant to guy. The man of the law winked at his companion as much as to\n",
      "say, “See what sport I will have with the old fool!” “Well,” said the\n",
      "haymaker, “I reckon I have about 2,000,000 acres.” “Two million acres!”\n",
      "gasped the attorney, gazing round; “pray, where is it?” “Down yere,”\n",
      "replied the farmer, pointing his long, skinny fingers at the ground. “I\n",
      "have got a hundred acres on top, and I reckon I own about down to the\n",
      "middle of the y’arth.” The man of the soil spake wiser than he knew. He\n",
      "was rich, but not exactly in the way he imagined, for a granite quarry\n",
      "of the finest kind was found on his land, which caused him to realize a\n",
      "large sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "862. STONE QUARRY.--Says a recent publication: “A man who has a quarry\n",
      "of good building stone, easily accessible, is richer than if he owned a\n",
      "gold mine.” But there are immense numbers of such quarries unworked and\n",
      "even unsuspected. It is not too much to say that there are at least a\n",
      "thousand farmers bemoaning unproductive land which contains beneath the\n",
      "surface that which can make them richer than anything they can possibly\n",
      "grow from the soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "863. ARTIFICIAL STONE.--Many kinds of artificial stone are now employed,\n",
      "such as Ransom’s concrete, Portland stone, etc. They are made by a\n",
      "mixture of cement, sand and gravel, and are molded into blocks. The\n",
      "value depends upon the kind of cement. No really good lime for this\n",
      "purpose has yet been found in the United States. The man who can\n",
      "discover a calcareous deposit capable of making a good, silicious or\n",
      "argillaceous hydraulic lime will have the market for manufactured stone\n",
      "practically in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "864. BAKED BRICK.--Late improvements in baking brick have reduced the\n",
      "time required to bake 100,000 bricks from fourteen to four days, and the\n",
      "amount of fuel from forty cords of wood to sixteen. The following\n",
      "suggestions by a brick-burner will show the path of fortune to those who\n",
      "can reduce the time still further. Mix a little charcoal in the clay.\n",
      "Double the length of the brick. If by either of these ways you can make\n",
      "the bricks a trifle cheaper, while retaining their qualities, you have\n",
      "acquired a fortune. “Lucky” Baldwin, a man afterward famous for his\n",
      "mining and real estate speculations, made his first large money in\n",
      "brick-burning. “I had no experience whatever then,” he said, “but I\n",
      "studied up the subject, thoroughly mastered the details, and cleared\n",
      "$1,500 in a month.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "865. GLASS BRICK.--Another new idea! Why not make a brick of glass,\n",
      "partially hollow, so that, filled with rarefied air, it can be a\n",
      "non-conductor of heat? Such a brick would be a great improvement on the\n",
      "present method of constructing conservatories, greenhouses and the walls\n",
      "of winter gardens. The plan is being tried in Europe, but there is no\n",
      "patent on the introduction, and nothing to stop an American from\n",
      "introducing a new kind of hothouse. The adage about the “man in a glass\n",
      "house” may be realized yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "866. RUBBER FLOORS.--Why do we go on in the old way, employing\n",
      "rough-sounding and creaking flooring, when there is a material which\n",
      "meets every want for a desirable floor? India rubber tiles prevent\n",
      "slipping, emit no sound under the foot, and have the additional element\n",
      "of an agreeable elasticity. It is a positive pleasure to walk on an\n",
      "India rubber floor. It is, of course, more expensive than wood, but the\n",
      "time is surely coming when every elegant dwelling, all expensive halls\n",
      "and public buildings, as well as the saloon decks of our first-class\n",
      "steamships, will have these improved floors. A man, ambitious to be rich\n",
      "and possessing a few thousands of capital, could hardly do a better\n",
      "thing than to manufacture rubber interlocking tiles, advertising them\n",
      "extensively and exhibiting models to builders.\n",

      "People who cater to public amusements are so many, their entertainments\n",
      "so diverse and their talents so unequal, that no general statement can\n",
      "be made about the remuneration for this kind of work. There are “stars”\n",
      "at the top who receive from $200 to $1,000 per night, and there are\n",
      "“mediocres,” or worse, at the bottom who barely eke out a living at $7 a\n",
      "week. No one should enter this field unless his talent is equal to his\n",
      "ambition. Here are a few of the prizes taken before the footlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "867. THE FARCE COMEDY.--Evans and Hoey purchased a comedy entitled “A\n",
      "Parlor Match.” Mr. Evans says: “We played it over 3,000 times, and at a\n",
      "rough estimate I think we must have cleared from $300,000 to $400,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "868. INSTRUMENTAL CONCERTS.--The possibilities of dollars in\n",
      "instrumental music are seemingly unlimited. Celebrated pianists have\n",
      "received almost fabulous sums. Rubinstein’s six months’ tour in America\n",
      "is said to have netted a profit of $60,000, and a second engagement was\n",
      "made for him at the rate of $2,500 per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "869. STAGE STARS.--The stage, like every other profession, is crowded at\n",
      "the bottom, but has room at the top. Beginners seldom get more than $15\n",
      "per week and commonly they receive much less. Leading people in road\n",
      "companies get $50 per week. Stars receive from $100 to $500 per night.\n",
      "Madame Celeste made $50,000 in this country. Edwin Forrest never\n",
      "received less than $200 per night. Edwin Booth sometimes played for $500\n",
      "per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "870. POPULAR LECTURERS.--These are richly rewarded for their hour or two\n",
      "of entertainment of an audience. John B. Gough’s price was $200 per\n",
      "night. Henry Ward Beecher, Wendell Phillips, and Bayard Taylor averaged\n",
      "the same figures. The receipts for Professor Tyndall’s thirty-five\n",
      "lectures in this country were $23,100; and Max O’Rell earned $5,290 by\n",
      "his lectures during a single week in Johannesburg, South Africa. Says a\n",
      "magazine note: “Money-making’s most promising field is that of a popular\n",
      "lecturer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "871. HAND SHADOWS.--Here is something new: Some amusement artists in\n",
      "England have conceived the idea of entertaining audiences with hand\n",
      "shadows. A candle, an oil lamp, or an arc light is used, and the beam of\n",
      "light passes through a small circular opening upon a sheet of\n",
      "ticket-writer’s holland. Sometimes a pipe or a piece of cardboard is\n",
      "used to heighten the effect, but for the most part the artist employs\n",
      "his hands only. With diligent practice the most comical effects, such as\n",
      "“Dressing for a Party,” “The Dog Fight,” etc., can be produced. Mr.\n",
      "Devant, the originator of the shadowgraph, convulses his audiences and\n",
      "reaps large profits for himself. America, where the humorous is quickly\n",
      "and keenly appreciated, offers a large field for this new kind of\n",
      "entertainment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "872. MUSEUM AND CIRCUS.--The vocation of the popular showman is a highly\n",
      "paying one. It appeals to two of the most powerful motives of human\n",
      "nature--the desire to be amused and amazed. P. T. Barnum made and lost\n",
      "two or three fortunes; Bailey, the successor of Barnum, and Dan Rice\n",
      "have also conducted highly successful shows. Dime museums in large\n",
      "cities often pay vast sums for curiosities and monstrosities, and still\n",
      "conduct a very profitable business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "873. GYMNASTS.--Athletes need to begin early in life in order to acquire\n",
      "suppleness of muscle. There is no profession that demands a severer\n",
      "training or regimen. A vast number of performers are constantly\n",
      "traveling through the country. Engagements with companies are made on\n",
      "exhibition of skill. Managers are always on the alert for something new.\n",
      "Some equestrians receive as high as $500 a week for self and horses;\n",
      "clowns often receive $100; rope walkers, $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "874. OPERA SINGERS.--Voice, gesture, grace, and beauty are the four\n",
      "qualities of success in the opera artist. Those who succeed receive\n",
      "princely sums for their services. Mario got $400 a night in\n",
      "Philadelphia. Tamberlik every time he sung a high note demanded $500.\n",
      "Piccolomini cost her manager over $5,000 a month. Madame Perer received\n",
      "$14,000 for the season. Genius and hard work are nowhere better paid\n",
      "than in the opera.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "875. MIMIC BATTLES.--Pain’s fireworks at Manhattan Beach, reproducing\n",
      "the “Capture of Manila” and “The Fall of Santiago,” have been immensely\n",
      "popular, sometimes drawing crowds numbering 10,000. A thousand dollars’\n",
      "worth of fireworks and _papier maché_ are burned in a single night\n",
      "during the season, but enormous as are the expenses we are informed that\n",
      "the proprietor seldom makes less than $500 a night. There is no patent\n",
      "on these exhibitions, and they may be repeated or imitated anywhere. A\n",
      "man who dares “burn money” in this way, or a stock company where the\n",
      "individual risk would be comparatively small, exhibiting these fireworks\n",
      "in all our great cities, would certainly reap handsome gains. Especially\n",
      "at this time, while the fervor of patriotism and the glow of enthusiasm\n",
      "over our recent victories are still at white heat, the enterprise could\n",
      "not fail to be paying. We would almost guarantee that a company which\n",
      "could set up as brilliant an exhibition as Pain’s in fifty leading\n",
      "cities would realize twenty-five per cent. on the investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "876. THEATRICAL ENTERPRISES.--Running a theater is risky business; it\n",
      "has its ups and downs, and the downs are as swift as the ups. Oscar\n",
      "Hammerstein, who has just lost all by an unsuccessful venture, says that\n",
      "once during the short period of four weeks he made $60,000. Daly,\n",
      "Frohman, Lester Wallack, and many others, have grown rich in the\n",
      "theatrical business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "877. DANCERS.--Members of the vaudeville are not so well paid as in many\n",
      "other arts for amusing the public, but special dancing “artists”\n",
      "sometimes receive almost fabulous sums. Famous dancers have received as\n",
      "high as $10,000 in the course of a season. Freda Maloff, the Turkish\n",
      "dancer, has just returned from the Klondike, where in the course of a\n",
      "few months she has made $62,000 in her profession, the miners literally\n",
      "showering her with nuggets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "878. MOVING PICTURES.--This latest and most popular form of amusement is\n",
      "coining money for the owners of the cinematograph, biograph, vitascope,\n",
      "or by whatever other name the instrument is called which causes the\n",
      "scenes portrayed on canvas to be instinct with moving life. The charge\n",
      "for an evening’s service is commonly $50.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "879. BAND PLAYERS.--Band players get from $1,000 to $5,000 a year,\n",
      "according to proficiency. Sousa, the leader of the celebrated band by\n",
      "his name, received $6,000 a year. There are always openings for good\n",
      "band players.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "880. IMPERSONATORS.--Dickens will probably always be the great resort\n",
      "for this class of entertainers. Of seven leading impersonators now on\n",
      "the platform, four portray his characters almost exclusively. It is a\n",
      "fine field for the elocutionist who has talents for mimicry. The average\n",
      "charge is $25 per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "881. ANCIENT BURLESQUES.--There are at least three forms of this\n",
      "amusement which are having great success. They are “The Village Choir,”\n",
      "“The Old Folks’ Concert,” and “Aunt Polly Bassett’s Singing School.” The\n",
      "last named has often cleared $100 in a single evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "882. RECITERS.--Reciters and readers, from Dickens to Hall Caine, have\n",
      "always been popular. The highest paid are well-known authors, who read\n",
      "from their own writings. Charles Dickens seldom received less than $200\n",
      "an evening. But the majority are glad to get engagements at from $10 to\n",
      "$25 a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "883. BELL RINGERS.--The discovery that many objects in nature could be\n",
      "made to give forth musical sounds has vastly widened the field of\n",
      "entertainment. Rocks, steam pipes, tumblers, and dinner bells have been\n",
      "drafted into service, the last named with notable success. In one\n",
      "company four young ladies have charmed the public ear with the melody of\n",
      "a score of hand bells. They have reaped rich harvests all over the\n",
      "country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "884. MAGICIANS.--This field has been somewhat overworked of late years,\n",
      "but the phenomenal success of such men as Blitz, the ventriloquist, and\n",
      "Hermann, the prestidigitator, show the possibilities in this line. Both\n",
      "these men bewitched the public for a whole generation, and made great\n",
      "fortunes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "885. STORY TELLERS.--This is a late revival of a form of amusement as\n",
      "old as the times of Homer. Those succeed best who are authors as well as\n",
      "elocutionists, making their own story and telling it fresh from the\n",
      "heart. We predict that this kind of entertainment is going to have a\n",
      "great run, and persons who have talent in this line will do well to\n",
      "furbish up their weapons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "886. CARTOONISTS.--Cartoonists and crayonists receive high figures for\n",
      "their work, as this kind of talent is rare. The chief of this class of\n",
      "artists received from $50 to $150 per night. Since his death, no worthy\n",
      "successor has been found, but there are many young fingers that are\n",
      "clever with chalk, and there is room for more. It is a very inviting\n",
      "field for persons who have the right gifts.\n",

      "business “professionally.” Especially in the great forests of the north\n",
      "are found thousands of men to whom the skins of wild beasts may be said\n",
      "to be meat and drink. Some of them even attain a competence and retire\n",
      "on their savings from the sale of furs. This is less surprising when we\n",

      "beyond what is needful for the bare necessaries of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "887. FAT QUAILS.--The quail has been called the game bird of America,\n",
      "because it is found almost everywhere. Some of the best shooting is\n",
      "found in North Carolina and Maryland, where a hunter of average skill\n",
      "can bag fifty birds a day. Price, $1.75 per dozen, or $7 for his day’s\n",
      "sport. Hunters must consult the game laws, which differ in various\n",
      "States of the Union.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "888. TROPICAL BIRDS.--It is estimated that the number of birds it is\n",
      "necessary to slaughter annually for the decoration of ladies’ hats\n",
      "amounts to the enormous number of 9,250,000. These are mostly tropical\n",
      "birds, and are shot in the forests of Brazil, Central America and\n",
      "Mexico. Some are natives of our Southern States, especially of Florida.\n",
      "On account of the great difference in the worth of the feathers, no\n",
      "estimate of the value can be given, but it is said that a skilled hunter\n",
      "of these bright wings can easily bag $10 worth of the birds in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "889. IVORY.--Elephant hunting in Africa is very profitable for those who\n",
      "have the courage and taste for the work. Seventy-five thousand elephants\n",
      "are slain yearly to supply the world’s knife-handles, billiard balls,\n",
      "and piano keys. There are a number of persons engaged in the killing of\n",
      "elephants for the sake of the sport, but most hunters do so for the\n",
      "profit. Ivory is worth about $1 a pound, and the tusks of a male\n",
      "elephant weigh about fifty pounds. The average of one elephant a day is\n",
      "considered a good day’s work, although five or six have been taken under\n",

      "beautiful material for robes, ladies’ sets, trimmings, etc., is the fur\n",

      "that good homes, fit for 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 people, could be made\n",
      "by irrigation. This system is yet in its infancy. In a few years\n",

      "silver in the refuse piled up around the mines would be much beneath the\n",
      "actual figures. The loss in iron and other metals, owing to the same\n",
      "cause, is utterly incalculable. The recent discoveries in magnetism\n",

      "has a charm for most people, and few advertisers will be able to resist\n",
      "your array of figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "915. FREE RENT.--Get your rent free on the same plan that some men get a\n",
      "building lot free. Take a large house, which, we will say, costs you $75\n",
      "per month. Such a house should have at least twelve rooms, six of which\n",
      "should be bedrooms. These rooms should be readily sublet for $3 a week,\n",
      "which, allowing for the fractions over the even weeks in a month,\n",
      "exactly pays your rent. By means of folding-beds you can readily convert\n",
      "some of the remaining six into sleeping rooms. If your family is small,\n",
      "a parlor can be so used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "916. X-RAYS AND X-BILLS.--The fluoroscope is a new thing. It is a great\n",
      "thing to see the bones of one’s hands, or keys imbedded in two inches of\n",
      "solid wood. You can invent many other ways of making the novelty\n",
      "interesting. People pay to see what is novel. With proper advertising, a\n",
      "really good fluoroscope exhibition should net at least $10 a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "917. GOLDEN SAILS.--Cleopatra’s barge may not have had golden sails, but\n",
      "if you live along shore, especially near a summer resort, you can turn\n",
      "your sails into gold, and make the wind waft you money by taking parties\n",
      "for an outing on the water. You should get $10 for a party of six; $15\n",
      "for a party of ten, etc. The requisites are a good boat, made attractive\n",
      "by awning and colored cushions, fishing tackle, bait, etc., and a\n",
      "pleasant, obliging disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "918. GAME PRESERVE.--If you live far inland, you can buy at cheap rates\n",
      "a wild mountain or a large tract of wilderness. Around this construct a\n",
      "high fence and stock your purchase with game. All this will require\n",
      "capital, but you will find ample returns for your investment in the\n",
      "rates which you will charge city sportsmen for a day’s sport. These\n",
      "hunters care little for the money if they can have a good day’s sport.\n",
      "After your game preserve becomes well known, through liberal\n",
      "advertising, $25 a day on your investment during the season should be a\n",
      "very modest expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "919. THE JUNK SHOP.--One of the things most in demand to-day is iron.\n",
      "This is the iron age. It is displacing brick for building and wood for\n",
      "ships. And yet how much goes to waste! Stoves, pots, kettles, rails,\n",
      "machinery, wagon springs, car wheels, pillars, girders, and a multitude\n",
      "of other forms of this valuable metal go to waste. The junk shop is a\n",
      "mine. Manufacturers will pay you fifty cents per 100 pounds. The fact is\n",
      "not generally known, but many junk dealers have become rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "920. OLD NEWSPAPERS.--Newspapers should not be sold to the ragman until\n",
      "they have been scissored, and perhaps not then. In New York there is a\n",
      "man who makes a business of preserving newspapers. You can get almost\n",
      "any copy of any paper for a number of years back. Copies forty years old\n",
      "bring as high as $20 apiece. A copy twenty years old will bring $4 or\n",
      "$5. Copies more than one year old and less than five sell from fifty\n",
      "cents to one dollar. If salable, every day increases the value of your\n",
      "stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "921. THE BOOK STALL.--Where come the books on the street stalls that\n",
      "sell for such marvelously low prices? From the cellars (would-be\n",
      "sellers) of publication houses. These are the books that will not sell\n",
      "at rates profitable to the publishers, and are bought up by the thousand\n",
      "at small rates. Many of them come from the libraries of persons\n",
      "deceased, and from the bookcases of men tired of carting them around in\n",
      "this moving age. Sold at fifteen, twenty or twenty-five cents apiece,\n",
      "there is a large profit in these books, for they are often bought at $10\n",
      "per thousand--that is, a penny apiece. Profits at ten cents, 900 per\n",
      "cent. Bought at $50 per thousand, you have still 400 per cent. Pretty\n",
      "fair profits indeed! Let us no longer despise the old dealer in\n",
      "second-hand books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "922. OLD FURNITURE.--Furniture made of the best material brings large\n",
      "prices. Only slightly marred, chairs and other kinds of household\n",
      "furniture often made of costly woods, are stored away as useless in the\n",
      "attic. These could frequently be purchased at very low prices, the\n",
      "owners being glad to get rid of them as an incumbrance. Yet a little\n",
      "money would make them as good as new. Five dollars expended on a chair\n",
      "that originally cost $50 and was repurchased in a dilapidated state for\n",
      "$10; it was sold by the adroit second-hand dealer for $25; and the\n",
      "purchaser considered it an excellent bargain. The dealer’s profit was\n",
      "$10. Time consumed in repair, one day and a half. The man earned\n",
      "$6.66-1/3 per day. Some in the same line have done much better. With\n",
      "competent helpers and with industry in hunting up old furniture, these\n",
      "figures should be trebled and quadrupled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "923. PUBLIC CONVENIENCE ROOM.--Establish it on some prominent\n",
      "thoroughfare. It need not be very large. Suppose the rent to be $25 per\n",
      "month. Let it be understood that for five cents you will furnish\n",
      "materials for correspondence (pen, ink and paper), a writing desk,\n",
      "brushes band lacking for shoes (not the services of a bootblack), a\n",
      "whisk broom, a mirror, the use of a daily paper, a city directory, a\n",
      "large map of the city, information on points of interest concerning the\n",
      "things worth seeing, directions how to reach any part of the city, sofas\n",
      "and easy chairs for resting, and the use of a toilet room. All for five\n",
      "cents! You should have at least 200 patrons a day; receipts, $10.\n",
      "Besides, you could sell stationery, confectionery, cigars, magazines,\n",
      "and many other small articles in common use. The place could\n",
      "advantageously be established in connection with a restaurant. Do you\n",
      "know that some of the largest fortunes have been made from just such\n",
      "five-cent charges. A millionaire street-railroad magnate, being asked\n",
      "recently what his business was, replied: “Oh! just a five-cent\n",
      "business--that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "924. GENERAL ADVICE.--Here is something entirely new: Thousands of\n",
      "people want information, but do not know where to get it. Some write to\n",
      "the newspapers, some ask friends. It would be of great advantage if such\n",
      "persons could consult people who have more time to look into their\n",
      "affairs than a newspaper editor, and who are more disinterested than\n",
      "friends. Let it be known that you will give tips on horse races, inside\n",
      "information about stock, points about the purchase of real estate,\n",
      "advice about law matters, suggestions about the investment of money, or\n",
      "any other information that may be required. Have on hand a stock of\n",
      "dictionaries, gazetteers, directories, encyclopedias, and world books of\n",
      "general information. You may charge ten cents for a simple consultation\n",
      "of five minutes. You can give a great deal of information in five\n",
      "minutes, if your questioner knows how to ask and you how to answer.\n",
      "Fifteen cents for ten minutes, twenty-five cents for twenty minutes,\n",
      "thirty-five cents for an half hour, and half a dollar for an hour. This\n",
      "business might be combined with the Public Convenience Room in the last\n",
      "number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "925. LANGUAGE CLASSES.--Here is one on a new plan. A French teacher has\n",
      "hit upon the idea of combining work and play in a novel manner. The\n",
      "classes form a club, which meets as in progressive euchre. The game is\n",
      "played after the old style of authors. Upon blank white cards are\n",
      "written the words to be used in sentences at the table. One table has\n",
      "cards containing the names of clothing, another of furniture, and so on.\n",
      "The players remain a certain length of time at each table, and then pass\n",
      "to the next, each player visiting every table during the session of the\n",
      "club. Afterward light refreshments are served by the teacher, and the\n",
      "subjects announced for the next meeting. The idea is a taking one, and\n",
      "capable of great elaboration. An up-to-date teacher ought to have\n",
      "immense success with this plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "926. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.--The business opportunities advertised in\n",
      "a single New York paper average 25 a day, 200 on Sunday, or about 17,500\n",
      "a year. One man claims that $10,000 can be realized in two weeks by the\n",
      "opportune venture of $1,000 in real estate. Another offers stock in a\n",
      "$10,000 mine which he is sure will shortly be worth $100,000. A third\n",
      "offers $5,000 for the use of $3,000 one year in mining operations. A\n",
      "fourth wants a backer for a new power, in which $5,000,000 will be\n",
      "easily realized. Most of these “opportunities” are doubtless illusive,\n",
      "while many are bare-faced frauds; yet among the myriads there may be\n",
      "some genuine chances for money-making. A shrewd man might find a bonanza\n",
      "in this mine of opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "927. MINE OWNERS.--Mr. Demullers, of Jefferson County, N. Y., a few\n",
      "years ago went to El Paso, Mexico, as a workman. To-day he owns the most\n",
      "valuable turquoise mine in the world, and is known as the “Turquoise\n",
      "King.” One recent shipment netted him $10,000. Another man in South\n",
      "America is known as the “Nitrate King,” and is said to be the richest\n",
      "man on the Western Continent. He also was once a poor man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "928. CATTLE RAISERS.--Six years ago Grant Gillet was a station agent in\n",
      "a small town in Kansas, working for a bare living. He made an engagement\n",
      "as cattle feeder, and from that position worked himself up into wealth\n",
      "by buying and selling cattle. He actually made half a million dollars in\n",
      "four years, and was known as the Millionaire Cowboy. Another man this\n",
      "last year bought Texas cattle for $432,000, and sold them for $540,000,\n",
      "making $108,000 in four months. This simply shows what opportunities\n",
      "there are for shrewd men in the cattle business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "929. STUMP SPEAKERS.--Men of oratorical ability have an opportunity\n",
      "during two or three months of every year to earn considerable money in\n",
      "political campaigns. Both of the great parties employ the best talent,\n",
      "the pay depending partly upon one’s convincing logic, but mainly upon\n",
      "the celebrity of the speaker. The lowest compensation is $5 a night, but\n",
      "noted speakers have received $100, and even more, for one short speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "930. ARTISTIC HOME BUILDERS.--These are not speculators, but men who\n",
      "have built homes for their own occupancy, yet have been induced to sell\n",
      "by the high prices offered. We know of no less than three persons in\n",
      "this present year who have made $3,000 to $5,000 each in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "931. CEMETERY OWNERS.--Cemetery lots have proved good paying property to\n",
      "those who know how to manage it. Land which costs from $1,000 to $5,000\n",
      "an acre is divided up into parcels one rod or one-half rod square, and\n",
      "sold for from $100 to $500 a plot. Mr. Th. E. Tinsley became a\n",
      "millionaire through graveyard operations in Texas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "932. GLASS BALL SHOOTERS.--The names of Carver and Bogardus have become\n",
      "continental by reason of their skill in hitting glass balls shot out of\n",
      "a trap. There is hardly any kind of sport more exciting, and there is\n",
      "always a large class who will patronize a rifle contest. These men\n",
      "pocketed fortunes by the exhibition of their skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "933. ENTERTAINMENT BUREAUS.--A Lecture Bureau in Brooklyn has the names\n",
      "of over 500 persons, embracing all kinds of talent, booked to interest\n",
      "and amuse its patrons. The manager, by having several engagements on\n",
      "every night of the week, and charging five per cent. of profits, is\n",
      "growing rich. There is room for a bureau of this kind in every large\n",
      "city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "934. ICE-CREAM MANUFACTURERS.--Ten million quarts of ice-cream are\n",
      "annually sold in New York, 65,000 quarts a day being the average\n",
      "consumption in warm weather. “It is nothing,” says a prominent maker,\n",
      "“for a great establishment to dispose of 35,000 quarts in one day.” An\n",
      "idea of the money in the business may be formed from the fact that the\n",
      "value of the annual output is about $3,500,000, of which fully one-third\n",
      "is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "935. GOLD HUNTERS.--F. E. Simmons, of Montana, went to the Klondike less\n",
      "than a year ago. He suffered every hardship and nearly lost his life on\n",
      "the journey, but he returned with half a million dollars. There are a\n",
      "few prizes there, as in all mining districts, but the majority of gold\n",
      "hunters do not succeed. Yet Mr. J. Partridge, a mining expert, who has\n",
      "thoroughly examined the region, says the wealth of the Klondike is\n",
      "inexhaustible, and he predicts that $30,000,000 will be taken out next\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "936. ASPHALT COMPANIES.--Here is an example of the enormous profits made\n",
      "by these companies. In one city the mayor, suspecting the charges were\n",
      "exorbitant, forced them to a lower scale, when the company actually\n",
      "agreed to do for $1.50 per yard what they had hitherto received $2.25\n",
      "for laying. This last was a living profit, but the profits over and\n",
      "above a fair compensation were seventy-five cents per square yard. This\n",
      "is the way contractors for the government get rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "937. HORSE JOCKEYS.--Small men weighing not over 100 pounds have an\n",
      "opportunity to earn money by riding horses on the race track. As the\n",
      "race often depends upon the judgment, skill, and balance of the rider,\n",
      "the owner wants the qualities of a man in the body of a boy. Jockeys\n",
      "receive on different tracks from $10 to $25 for their day’s work, but\n",
      "riders of winners often receive presents of $10 and even more. Tod\n",
      "Sloan, a rider for the Dwyers, it is said, received $1,000 for a trip to\n",
      "the English Derby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "938. WIG MAKING.--In a large city where there are several theaters, you\n",
      "can do a good business in wigmaking. The trade is easily learned, and\n",
      "the goods will command prices varying from the mustache of fifty cents\n",
      "to the court wig for which you should receive $7 or $8. A location near\n",
      "a large theater is desirable. Actors are very fastidious about their\n",
      "make-up, and willing to pay good prices. It is said that Edwin Forrest\n",
      "once paid $300 for a striking wig.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "939. BOOK REPAIRING.--Almost everybody has books that are out of order,\n",
      "and yet, strange to say, we have never heard of any one making a\n",
      "business of repairing books. For your outfit you need several sheets of\n",
      "paper of different sizes and thickness, a few strips of leather, some\n",
      "stout pieces of cloth, a bottle of glue, a penknife, and a pair of\n",
      "scissors. These can be carried in a small hand bag. Practice on your own\n",
      "and your friends’ books before striking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "940. THE HOUSEHOLD PACK.--Select twenty-five articles most needed in a\n",
      "household. They should be compact, so as to go in a small box or bag.\n",
      "They should be such things as soap, starch, shoe blacking, shoe polish,\n",
      "stove blacking, cement, mucilage, matches, bluing, yeast cakes, baking\n",
      "powders, etc. These are articles in constant demand and consumption.\n",
      "They can be sold from door to door, mostly among people of limited\n",
      "means, and if sold cheap there is profit, because they are articles\n",
      "which every one wants, and many sales, even if the profits are small,\n",
      "mean large results. There are many peddlers who are foreigners, and\n",
      "having made a competence, go back to their own country to enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "941. PAWNBROKERS’ PROFITS.--The pawnbrokers’ business has been largely\n",
      "given up to the Jews, but there is no good reason why it should be.\n",
      "Pawnbrokers make immense profits. The amount of the loan is not above\n",
      "one-third the value of the article. The goods are frequently not\n",
      "redeemed. Then there are the pawnbrokers’ sales, at which the articles\n",
      "command at least one-half their value. The pawnbroker gets ten per cent.\n",
      "or more on money loaned, and if the goods are sold he gets the\n",
      "difference between one-third and one-half values; that is, if an article\n",
      "be worth $100, the loan is $33.33-1/3. The amount realized at the sale\n",
      "is $50. Pawnbrokers’ profits, $16.66-2/3. This is the reason most\n",
      "pawnbrokers get rich.\n",

      "brought him into Wall Street, where he made over $70,000,000 in forty\n",
      "years.\n",
      "\n",
      "James Fisk came down from Vermont a penniless boy, but getting into the\n",

      "\n",
      "Ferdinand Ward, called the Napoleon of Finance, had an unequaled gift\n",
      "for shrewd speculation, and might have excelled all contemporaries had\n",

      "Of the last named it may be mentioned--to show how little a college\n",
      "education has to do with success in business--that he was very\n",
      "illiterate, possessing only a scanty knowledge of grammar, and even of\n",
      "spelling. It is related that on one occasion he told his cashier that he\n",
      "would set the safe lock on the word “door.” When the cashier wanted to\n",
      "open the safe, he tried “door” in vain. Knowing his employer’s queer\n",
      "methods of spelling he tried varieties on “door,” such as “dore,”\n",
      "“doar,” etc., but all in vain. At last he was obliged to go to the hotel\n",
      "and awake his employer, who had gone to bed. “Uncle Dan’l” was quite\n",
      "crusty at being awakened, and told his cashier again that he had set the\n",

      "A rule for speculators is: “Don’t invest on professional advice.” Your\n",
      "advisers have “an ax to grind.” A man once ordered a broker to buy 1,000\n",
      "shares of Erie when the price was 94; it immediately dropped, and he\n",
      "ordered it sold when it was 92-1/2. In half an hour he returned and\n",
      "ordered it bought again. It had then gone up to 95. After consulting\n",
      "again with “friends,” he again ordered it sold. The market then was down\n",
      "to 90. He came back the fifth time and said: “I consulted one man who\n",
      "told me to buy; then another who told me to sell. I understand that one\n",
      "is called a bull and the other a bear. I don’t know much about these\n",
      "names, but I do know that I have been a jackass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A much safer plan is to follow the lead of shrewd speculators. In Wall\n",
      "Street you should reverse the advice given to the disciples concerning\n",
      "the Pharisees. Christ said, “Do as they say, but not as they do.” But\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "942. CITY BONDS.--These are generally among the best securities for\n",
      "investment. The element of speculation comes in when they are bought\n",
      "below par in the belief of an early rise. A sharp Yankee bought $100,000\n",

      "Philippine Islands, will be worth one billion dollars annually under\n",
      "American development. Here is an immense opportunity for every form of\n",

      "current year--1898--Mr. J. R. Keene purchased 80,000 shares at $90.\n",

      "945. COLLAPSED RAILROADS.--For a capitalist there are few more promising\n",
      "fields than the buying up of collapsed or run down railroads. Mr. George\n",
      "I. Seney accumulated a large fortune by purchasing at a little more than\n",
      "nominal figures bankrupt or embarrassed roads, and by thorough\n",
      "equipment, and by connection with more prosperous roads, soon put them\n",
      "in a paying condition. If you can get one end of a small road into a\n",

      "every great center of the world, and in this period of less than a year\n",

      "one could corner such a fortune in so short a time shows what may be\n",
      "accomplished with courage and capital. The safest rule for small and\n",
      "timid operators is to follow in the wake of these bold speculators, but\n",
      "not too far. It may be laid down almost with the certainty of a logical\n",

      "the field enters the market, he is bound to win at first, but bound to\n",
      "lose if he presses things too far, because the tremendous stress\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "947. ILLUMINATING COMPANIES.--Of the ten illuminating companies of\n",
      "Brooklyn, not one last year paid a less dividend than five per cent.,\n",
      "and one paid ten per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "954. FLOUR TRUST.--British and American stockholders have combined to\n",

      "company will be about $150,000,000, and the output 95,000 barrels of\n",
      "flour daily. Should the profits be only twenty-five cents a barrel, the\n",

      "when it is stated that the present output is more than $15,000,000. The\n",

      "956. TELEPHONE MONOPOLY.--One of the greatest monopolies of the country\n",
      "is that of the Bell Telephone. The company has increased its capital\n",
      "stock in eighteen years from $110,000 to $30,000,000. In that time it\n",
      "has earned $42,903,680. It pays dividends of eighteen per cent., and\n",
      "could pay more, if allowed to do so by its charter. The surplus is used\n",

      "run the elevated and surface railroads and the factories of the\n",

      "heating purposes. They will control more than 1,000 square miles of the\n",
      "watersheds of the Catskills, and the mountain streams will be harnessed\n",

      "names of such well known persons as Thomas C. Platt, Silas B. Dutcher,\n",
      "and Edward Lauterbach as interested persons in the scheme, and it is\n",
      "said that the undertaking will be on a much grander scale than the\n",
      "similar one at Niagara, to which the Vanderbilts, the Webbs, and other\n",

      "958. INDUSTRIAL STOCKS.--Here is a partial list of the best paying\n",
      "stocks. Of course, where the interest is large, the price of the stocks\n",
      "is correspondingly high. The investor, before paying the high prices\n",
      "asked, should use his best judgment in considering whether the present\n",

      "Lake Shore, Michigan Central, New York Central, New York and New Haven,\n",
      "are safe and profitable investments, if you can get them. The last-named\n",
      "road has paid ten per cent. for many years, though recently the figures\n",

      "price of twenty-five cents a night. The location was down town in New\n",
      "York, the congested district where congregate travelers, tradesmen,\n",
      "workingmen, and the vast class of floaters. His rooms were nearly always\n",
      "full. Income per day, $25. Daily expenses: Night clerk, $2; two\n",
      "chambermaids ($15 each per month), $1. Rent, $5; lights, $1; laundry,\n",

      "$500, bought a tract of land in the outskirts of a suburban city for\n",
      "$1,500. The tract contained twenty acres, and he paid $500 down and gave\n",
      "a mortgage for the remainder. He had the property surveyed and divided\n",
      "into lots, eight to the acre. The tract was located on the bend of a\n",
      "river, and he called it “Riverside Park.” Lots were advertised for sale\n",
      "at $100 each. The first year he cleared off the mortgage by the sale of\n",
      "lots. He had remaining 145 lots. In five years he sold all these lots at\n",
      "an average price of $85. Total amount received for lots, $13,825. Price\n",
      "of land, $1,500. Taxes, $625. Surveying, grading, etc., $762.\n",
      "Advertising and other methods of booming the property, $1,272. Total\n",
      "cost and expenses, $3,534. Net profit, $10,291. By repeating this\n",
      "process on a larger scale in another city, this young man, who started\n",
      "at sixteen years of age with nothing, and by hard work and economy had\n",
      "save $500 at twenty-one, found himself at the age of forty with\n",
      "$100,000. The secrets of his success were four: Shrewdness in foreseeing\n",
      "where property would be likely to advance; energy in quickly changing\n",
      "the property from a farm into building lots; taste in making them\n",
      "attractive, and giving the place a pretty name; and, most important of\n",
      "all, the knowing how to create a market. We have known this process\n",
      "repeated by others with almost equally marked success. In all our large\n",

      "generation ago. Others, being decidedly odd in themselves, will\n",
      "doubtless always be pursued only by a few, and considered by the many to\n",
      "be curious ways of making a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "Success is easy when once you succeed. This is the case with goods which\n",
      "have achieved a name. Frequently the founder of the name is bankrupt,\n",
      "retired or dead; but the goods continue to be manufactured and sold\n",
      "under the original trade-mark. Countless thousands of dollars are paid\n",
      "every year for shoes, hats, hardware, groceries, and innumerable other\n",
      "articles, at rates above the average price when the goods are not a\n",
      "farthing better. The deluded buyers are simply paying for a name.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others have a mania for the collection of all kinds of bric-à-brac--old\n",
      "coins and rare books are seized and hoarded as eagerly as if made of\n",
      "gold. This mania is harmless in itself, and gives its possessors no\n",
      "doubt much pleasure, but they are made the prey of Shylocks who carry on\n",
      "a regular trade of manufacturing “old” articles.\n",
      "\n",
      "So also with the “relic” craze. There are actually manufactories where\n",
      "relics are made. Conscienceless persons take advantage of the curiosity\n",
      "and piety of travelers to palm off all sorts of “relics” upon them at\n",
      "preposterous prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there are the limitless imitations that are on the market. Some of\n",
      "them, such as patent medicines, brands of groceries, oleomargarine,\n",
      "etc., are imitations pure and simple; others are adulterations with more\n",
      "or less of the genuine. So vast and profitable are these methods of\n",
      "deception that the government has been compelled to interfere to protect\n",
      "its citizens from fraud.\n",

      "The box-office clique is only a less pernicious, but equally barefaced,\n",

      "will see a solitary man wend his way to the theater and silently square\n",

      "another, so that by midnight perhaps a dozen or twenty of these\n",
      "grim-faced men are lined against the wall. Not one of them has the\n",
      "slightest idea of seeing the play. It is simply their way of earning a\n",

      "highest bidders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of the “cure” faddists there number is legion. We do not mean the makers\n",
      "of patent medicines, of which we have treated elsewhere, but the men who\n",
      "profess to believe they have some unique and original way of ridding\n",
      "mankind of evil. Thus we have the gold cure, the barefoot cure, the\n",
      "mind cure, the faith cure, the cold water cure, and the hot water\n",

      "\n",
      "Of the “watered” stock and other incorporated swindles, almost every\n",
      "investor has purchased his experience at a dear rate. This is a method\n",
      "of increasing one’s capital stock in a company without the contribution\n",
      "of any new funds, and it is one of the most common of frauds.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are but a few of the many curious and ingenious ways by which\n",
      "people attempt to make a living. In many cases, especially the\n",
      "last-named, there is no doubt that the promoters of these enterprises\n",
      "often do get rich at the expense of the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other strange ways of making a living are the catching of butterflies or\n",
      "canary birds at a penny apiece, and the sifting of ashes and collecting\n",
      "of cinders. In London sand is sold on the street for scouring and as\n",
      "gravel for birds. Then there is “the curiosity shop.” In Genoa, there\n",
      "are marriage brokers who have a list of names of marriageable girls,\n",
      "divided into different classes, with an account of the fortunes,\n",
      "personal attraction, etc., of each. They charge two to three per cent.\n",
      "commission on a contract. In Munich there are female bill posters, and\n",
      "in Paris there are women who make a living by letting out chairs on the\n",
      "street. Also, in the same city, men are hired to cry the rate of\n",
      "exchange. Then there are the men who gather old clothes, and the street\n",
      "sweepers. There are 6,000 rag gatherers in Paris. Then there are the\n",
      "refuse cleaners, and the glass-eye makers, the latter furnishing you\n",
      "with a crystal eyeball at rates from $10 to $20 when the physicians and\n",
      "oculists charge $60 or $70 for similar services. Then there are postage\n",
      "stamp gatherers and chair menders. In fact the ways of making a living\n",
      "are legion. We formulate a few of the best of this class:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "981. EXPERTS.--There are many kinds--accountant, color, handwriting,\n",
      "etc. Any one who confines his life-work to a very small and special\n",
      "field can command a large price for his services. Experts often receive\n",
      "$10 a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "982. DETECTIVES.--Besides the men in the employ of the United States and\n",
      "local authorities, there are many who work in private agencies. The pay\n",
      "depends upon the nature of the work and the wealth of the employers. In\n",
      "celebrated cases where suspected parties had to be shadowed for months,\n",
      "a detective has received as much as $5,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "983. TRAVELING POETS.--Since the days of Wesley, the traveling preacher\n",
      "has been a familiar figure, but who since the time of Homer has seen a\n",
      "traveling poet? yet one called on the author the other day. His patrons\n",
      "are chiefly obscure people who pay from $1 to $10 to have their history,\n",
      "home, achievements, or virtues lauded in verse. It is hardly necessary\n",
      "to say that the poems are not published, but kept as household treasures\n",
      "for coming grandchildren.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "984. OLD COINS.--Some have found a profitable source of revenue in the\n",
      "hunting and hoarding of old coins. One numismatist recently sold a\n",
      "dollar coin of 1804 for $5,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "985. PURVEYOR OF PERSONALS.--A Russian named Romeitre started this\n",
      "enterprise in a small way. Now we have press-clipping bureaus so large\n",
      "as to employ seventy persons each. In some of these places from 5,000 to\n",
      "7,000 papers are read every day, and the weekly clippings amount to more\n",
      "than 100,000. There are now press-clipping bureaus in nearly all of our\n",
      "large cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "986. GOLD ON SEA BOTTOM.--Another class of men make money out of other\n",
      "men’s misfortunes; that is, by stripping wrecks of their valuables.\n",
      "Others secure the services of divers and search the bottom of the\n",
      "ocean, where vessels containing treasures are supposed to have gone\n",
      "down. A few years ago a company from England went with divers to a place\n",
      "near Bermuda, where a vessel had been sunk a long time before, and\n",
      "secured from the wreck the sum of $1,500,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "987. RARE BOOKS.--The art of book collecting has been pursued with\n",
      "profit by some persons. It requires no capital, if one simply confines\n",
      "his efforts to book-stalls, though, if pursued on a large scale, money\n",
      "is required for advertising and correspondence. Mr. Charles B. Foote, of\n",
      "New York City, is a veteran bibliophile, and has made a specialty of\n",
      "first editions. Recently he made three auction sales of his stores, and\n",
      "realized more than $20,000, and his home is full of treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "988. OLD ITALIAN VIOLINS.--They sell at prices ranging from $500 to\n",
      "$5,000, when you can buy them at all, which is seldom, for they are\n",
      "mostly in the hands of wealthy collectors. Now we will let you into a\n",
      "great secret. It is not the kind of wood or the form of the instrument\n",
      "alone which produces the rare quality of sound, but it lies also in the\n",
      "kind of varnish used. By experimenting with varnish, you can produce a\n",
      "“Stradivarius,” which will sell for almost any amount you choose to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "989. MAGIC SILK.--It seems like the trick of the magician to speak of\n",
      "turning cotton into silk, but it can actually be done, or at least\n",
      "cotton can be made to resemble silk, so that discrimination between the\n",
      "two fabrics is impossible. About fifty years ago, one Mercer, a French\n",
      "chemist, showed that cotton when subjected to the action of concentrated\n",
      "acid or alkalies, contracts and has a greater affinity for dyes, but it\n",
      "has only just been discovered that “mercerization” gives also a\n",
      "brilliant luster to the cotton. The cotton is stretched violently during\n",
      "the operation, and when an energetic rubbing is added to the tension the\n",
      "tissue receives a permanent luster. It thus replaces silk at a fraction\n",
      "of its cost, and offers a splendid chance for financial enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "990. THE GOLD CURE.--If the gold cure for which so much is claimed can\n",
      "really take away the appetite for liquor, there is an immense field for\n",
      "its exercise and room for the making of many fortunes in the cure of\n",
      "America’s drunkards. In the United States alone an exceedingly moderate\n",
      "estimate makes the number of this unfortunate class 1,600,000. At the\n",
      "very modest calculation that only one-tenth of these can be induced to\n",
      "try the cure, and if each case nets the proprietor of the institution\n",
      "only $25--and the estimate should probably be doubled and even\n",
      "trebled--there are $15,000,000 in it for the public benefactors who can\n",
      "thus curb the evil of dram-drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "991. THE TELEPHONE NEWSPAPER.--Here is an idea for newspaper men: In\n",
      "Budapest, Hungary, there is a telephone newspaper, the first and only\n",
      "one in the world. The main office is in telephone communication with the\n",
      "Reichstadt (corresponding to our Congress), and it often happens that\n",
      "important speeches are known to the public while the speaker is still\n",
      "addressing the house; the latest reports from stock exchanges as well as\n",
      "political news are heard before any paper has printed them, a short\n",
      "summary of all important items is given at noon and again in the\n",
      "evening; subscribers are entertained with music and literary articles in\n",
      "the evenings, the latter being often spoken into the telephone by the\n",
      "original authors. The cost is only two cents a day, and the company are\n",
      "said to be making money even at that figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "992. RACE AND STOCK TIPPERS.--In addition to the regular brokers who\n",
      "supply tips to their customers, there is now a set of professional\n",
      "tippers who profess to have “inside information,” and make it a business\n",
      "to give tips to anybody who will pay for them. They receive in some\n",
      "cases a fixed sum from their patrons, and in other cases they take a\n",
      "liberal percentage of the profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "993. PROMOTERS.--This is a new vocation. The promoter “promotes”\n",
      "anything and everything that will pay. If you want to accomplish\n",
      "anything from the launching of a railroad enterprise to the selling of a\n",
      "penny patent, you pay the “promoter” a certain sum to do the work. He\n",
      "buys influence, lobbies legislators, controls newspapers and hypnotizes\n",
      "the public generally. Not all promoters come as high as Mr. Ernest\n",
      "Tooley, whose own price can be imagined when he claims to have paid\n",
      "$250,000 to English peers for their influence; yet we learn that the\n",
      "American Tin Plate Company gave the promoters of the Trust $10,000,000\n",
      "in stock for their work.\n",

      "of course, places where great responsibilities are incurred. Strange as\n",
      "it may seem, however, occupations where thousands of human lives are\n",
      "imperiled are not compensated at so high a rate as those where great\n",
      "finances are at stake. Here are a few of the golden plums:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "994. ELECTRICAL EXPERTS.--The use of electricity has so increased in the\n",
      "last few years, and so many new uses have been found for it, that there\n",
      "are to-day nearly fifty different departments of human labor where it is\n",
      "employed, and naturally these have differentiated as many kinds of\n",
      "electricians. A young man in a New York establishment says “I am in\n",
      "receipt of a salary of $4,000 as superintendent of the dynamo building,\n",
      "and recently I had an offer of $7,000 to go with a new company out\n",
      "West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "995. THE CONFIDENTIAL MAN.--Another man in New York began his career in\n",
      "a store at wages of only $7 a week. He is now the firm’s confidential\n",
      "man, who decides on all important purchases, and receives a salary of\n",
      "$8,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "996. THE ADVERTISING AGENT.--The advertising agency is from a financial\n",
      "standpoint the most important department in the make-up of a paper or\n",
      "periodical. On one of our most popular magazines there is to-day a young\n",
      "man hardly over thirty years of age who has advanced through the various\n",
      "grades of work until he is now superintendent of the advertising\n",
      "department, receiving a remuneration of $7,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "997. GREAT DAILY EDITORS.--Editors of leading departments in our great\n",
      "dailies receive from $2,000 upward. Managing editors and\n",
      "editors-in-chief receive many times that sum. One man in the New York\n",
      "_Sun_ office has for his services a salary of $15,000, and besides this\n",
      "does outside literary work to the amount of $5,000 yearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "998. MEDICAL SPECIALISTS.--There is still “room at the top” of the\n",
      "medical world. The largest harvests are reaped by those who devote\n",
      "themselves to particular parts of the human framework, and at last are\n",
      "able to set up as “consulting physicians.” One doctor, whose apartments\n",
      "are crowded daily, informed the author of this work that he was treating\n",
      "eleven hundred and fifty patients. The celebrated Dr. Loomis for some\n",
      "time before his death made $50,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "999. LEGAL COUNSELORS.--What is true of medicine is equally so of the\n",
      "law. Specialists in such branches as real estate, legacies, insurance,\n",
      "etc., are in receipt of immense revenue. Celebrated bar-pleaders also\n",
      "have grown rich. The names of Rufus and Joseph Choate, of Wm. Evarts\n",
