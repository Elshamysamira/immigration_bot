      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The object of this work is to help people who are out of employment to\n",
      "secure a situation; to enable persons of small means to engage in\n",
      "business and become their own employers; to give men and women in\n",
      "various lines of enterprise ideas whereby they may succeed; and to\n",
      "suggest new roads to fortune by the employment of capital. The author\n",
      "has been moved to the undertaking by the reflection that there exists\n",
      "nowhere a book of similar character. There have indeed been published a\n",
      "multitude of books which profess to tell men how to succeed, but they\n",
      "all consist of merely professional counsel expressed in general terms.\n",
      "We are told that the secrets of success are “industry and accuracy,”\n",
      "“the grasping of every opportunity,” “being wide awake,” “getting up\n",
      "early and sitting up late,” and other cheap sayings quite as well known\n",
      "to the taker as to the giver. Even men who have made their mark, when\n",
      "they come to treat of their career in writing, seem unable to give any\n",
      "concrete suggestions which will prove helpful to other struggling\n",
      "thousands, but simply tell us they won by “hard work,” or by “close\n",
      "attention to business.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The author of this book has gone to work on a totally different plan. I\n",
      "have patiently collected the facts in the rise of men to wealth and\n",
      "power, have collated the instances and instruments of fortune, and from\n",
      "these have sifted out the real secrets of success. When as in a few\n",
      "cases, the worn-out proverbs and principles are quoted, these are\n",
      "immediately reinforced by individual examples of persons who attributed\n",
      "their advancement to the following of these rules; but, in general, the\n",
      "suggestions are new, and in very many cases plans and lines of work are\n",
      "proposed by the author which are entirely original, and so far as he\n",
      "knows, absolutely untried. Hence, the work becomes of incomparable value\n",
      "to business men who are constantly seeking new means to interest the\n",
      "public and to dispose of their goods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, the vast field of action treated of in this work lies beyond\n",
      "the experience of any one man, but the author has talked with business\n",
      "men in every walk in life and gleaned from them the essential facts in\n",
      "their career; in many instances these facts are not the things they have\n",
      "done, but the things they would do if they could begin again, thus\n",
      "giving the reader the benefit both of their success and failure. As a\n",
      "book offering opportunities to the ambitious; presenting openings to\n",
      "those seeking a wider scope for their faculties; affording stimulation\n",
      "to persons of sluggish blood; and giving away trade and business secrets\n",
      "never before divulged; the author feels confident that the little work\n",
      "stands unrivaled, and as such he modestly offers it to the public for\n",
      "its approval.\n",

      "Young men are often discouraged because the desirable places all seem to\n",
      "be filled. But remember there is always room for the right man. Says a\n",
      "New York millionaire: “I hold that any young man, possessing a good\n",
      "constitution and a fair degree of intelligence, may become rich.” Says\n",
      "another business man: “I have made a personal canvass of a dozen of the\n",
      "largest business houses in five different commercial and professional\n",
      "lines to see to what extent there exist openings for young men.” In only\n",
      "two of the houses approached were the heads of the firms satisfied the\n",
      "positions of trust in those houses were filled by capable men. And in\n",
      "each of these two houses I was told that “of course, if the right sort\n",
      "of a young man came along who could tell us something about our business\n",
      "we did not already know, we should not let him slip through our fingers.\n",
      "Positions can always be created. In four of the houses, positions had\n",
      "been open for six months or more, and the sharpest kind of a lookout\n",
      "kept for possible occupants. These positions commanded salaries all the\n",
      "way from $2,000 to $5,000 a year. In the publishing business, I know of\n",
      "no less than six positions actually yawning for the men to come and fill\n",
      "them--not clerical positions, but positions of executive authority.\n",
      "Young men are desired in these places because of their progressive ideas\n",
      "and capacity to endure work.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another prominent man who interviewed the heads of several large firms\n",
      "writes in a recent periodical as follows: “It is not with these firms a\n",
      "question of salary; it is a question of securing the highest skill with\n",
      "the most perfect reliability. This being secured, almost any salary to\n",
      "be named will be cheerfully paid. A characteristic of the business world\n",
      "to-day is that its institutions, empires in themselves, have grown to be\n",
      "too large for the handling of ordinary men. These institutions are\n",
      "multiplying in excess of the number of men whose business skill is broad\n",
      "and large enough to direct and command them. Hence, the really\n",
      "commanding business brain is at an immense premium in the market. A\n",
      "salary of $50,000 a year as president of a railroad or manufacturing\n",
      "company at first sight seems exorbitant; but the payment of such a\n",
      "salary usually means pure business. The right or the wrong man at the\n",
      "head of a great business interest means the making or the unmaking of\n",
      "fortunes for the stockholders. Only a single glance at the industrial\n",
      "world is needed to show that here is room for the advent of genius of\n",
      "the first order. This world, seething like a caldron, is boiling to the\n",
      "brim with questions of the most vexing and menacing kind.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Look at the men who reached the top of fortune’s ladder, and see under\n",
      "what discouraging circumstances they began. James Fisk, called the\n",
      "Prince of the Erie, rose to that position from a ragged newsboy.\n",
      "Stephen Girard began on nothing, and became the greatest millionaire of\n",
      "his time. Young men, would you scorn to row a boat for a living?\n",
      "Cornelius Vanderbilt plied a boat between Staten Island and New York.\n",
      "Would you tramp the country as a surveyor for a map? Jay Gould began in\n",
      "that way, and forty years later satisfied certain doubters of his\n",
      "financial standing by showing them certificates of stocks worth\n",
      "$80,000,000. Do you fear to have your hands calloused with ax or saw?\n",
      "John W. Mackay, who acquired a fortune of $20,000,000, started in life\n",
      "as a shipwright. Is it beneath your social station to handle butter and\n",
      "eggs? “Lucky” Baldwin, the multi-millionaire, kept a country store and\n",
      "made his first venture by taking his goods overland in a cart to Salt\n",
      "Lake City. Are your fingers too delicate for the broom handle? A. T.\n",
      "Stewart began his business career by sweeping out the store. Do you\n",
      "abhor vile odors? Peter Cooper made $6,000,000 in the glue business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tens of thousands are looking for a place. Most of them have had places,\n",
      "but could not keep them. If you follow all the rules below, having\n",
      "obtained a place, you will never need to seek one again. The place will\n",
      "seek you. Employers are in search of the qualities herein to be\n",
      "considered, and they are willing to pay liberally for them. They are\n",
      "qualities that come high everywhere. If you possess them, you can in a\n",
      "short time command your own price. But do not scorn to take the humblest\n",
      "place. Merit, like murder, will out. Be sure you have the winning cards\n",
      "and wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "1. THE SECRET OF WORK.--Men will employ you if you mean business. When\n",
      "you find men working, work with them. Lend a hand. Every employer would\n",
      "rather employ a busy man than an idle man. When he sees you working, he\n",
      "will watch you. If he likes you, he will make you an offer. A glazier,\n",
      "being refused work at a place where a church was being erected, put down\n",
      "his kit of tools, picked up the broken pieces of glass which the workmen\n",
      "had thrown away, and, laboring just as if he had been hired to work,\n",
      "fashioned the finest church window in the world, and became rich and\n",
      "famous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2. NATURE’S FURROW.--Plow in nature’s furrow. In general, a man is\n",
      "fitted for the thing he likes. Do that which you can do best. What you\n",
      "want to do you are called to do, and what you are called to do you can\n",
      "do. Darwin says that the fittest survive because they have a slight\n",
      "advantage over those which do not survive. Your liking for an occupation\n",
      "is the advantage you have over those who do not like it. Follow the\n",
      "hint, whether it be to publish a paper or peg shoes. A leading merchant\n",
      "in New York found his calling through having loaned money to a friend.\n",
      "He had to take his friend’s store to secure his money, and thus learned\n",
      "his gift for merchandise. The man was A. T. Stewart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3. GENERAL DETAILS.--The best general is General Details. In business\n",
      "life, no matter is small enough to be despised. To master an infinite\n",
      "number of small things is to prepare yourself to master great things.\n",
      "When your employers see that you have everything at your fingers’ ends,\n",
      "they will intrust you with larger interests, and greater responsibility\n",
      "means greater pay. John Jacob Astor knew the minutest point about every\n",
      "part of his great business. _That_ was the secret of his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4. THE PRISMATIC BRAIN.--Be many-sided, but transparent. Tell your\n",
      "employer where you have failed. Do not try to cover up a fault. Be\n",
      "absolutely honest. You may get along for a time on “shady” lines, but\n",
      "such success is only gained at the expense of ultimate loss. It is\n",
      "absolutely essential that your employer should have the utmost\n",
      "confidence in your integrity. Try by every means to gain that\n",
      "confidence. Court examination. Invite inspection. Remember that his\n",
      "profound belief in you--belief in you when out of business hours as well\n",
      "as in--is your surest stepping-stone to promotion. Character is power.\n",
      "Your success depends as much upon what you are as upon what you know or\n",
      "do. Stephen Girard once trusted his drayman to buy a shipload of tea\n",
      "worth $200,000. He trusted him because he knew his man, and he gave the\n",
      "young man the profits of the transaction, which amounted to $50,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5. THE BRIDLED TONGUE.--Do not cross your employer in any way. Never\n",
      "dispute with him. You may be sure that you are right, but do not say so.\n",
      "You need not be a Democrat or an Episcopalian because your employer is,\n",
      "but if you are wise you will avoid discussing with him questions of\n",
      "politics or religion. Courtesy pays. Ross Winans, of Philadelphia,\n",
      "secured a business that netted him $100,000 a year simply through his\n",
      "politeness to two Russian agents, to whom others in the same trade had\n",
      "accorded scant courtesy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6. STUDYING THE STAIR ABOVE.--Study, not stars, but stairs. Learn all\n",
      "about the position next above you. When you can point out new methods to\n",
      "your employer, advance new ideas, or suggest new channels of trade or\n",
      "lines of work, you are surely on the way to promotion. Only, be sure\n",
      "that your new ideas are practical. There is no more direct road to the\n",
      "confidence of your employer than for him to see that you understand any\n",
      "part of his affairs better than he does himself. Employ your spare\n",
      "moments in studying the business. While the other clerks are joking, do\n",
      "you be learning. While the students at the boarding-house in Andover\n",
      "were chaffing each other during the wait for breakfast, Joseph Cook\n",
      "would turn to a big dictionary in one corner of the room and look out a\n",
      "word. He climbed many stairs above them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7. THE MISSING FACTOR.--Your employers are wrestling with a question.\n",
      "They are uncertain whether to invest or not. They are doubtful about the\n",
      "character or standing of some man with whom they are or may become\n",
      "heavily involved. It will be worth thousands to you if you can procure\n",
      "any scrap of information that will help to set them right. A young clerk\n",
      "who discovered an error in Bradstreet’s was soon admitted to partnership\n",
      "in his employer’s firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8. THE MAGNIFYING GLASS.--Make the most of your present position. Wear\n",
      "magnifying glasses. Exalt the importance of every item. Let not the\n",
      "smallest thing be done in a slipshod way. If you are answering letters\n",
      "for the firm, answer them briefly but completely. Remember that brevity\n",
      "is not brusqueness. If you are waiting on customers, treat the small\n",
      "customer just as courteously as the large one. You may be sure that your\n",
      "employer knows the market value of politeness. In the Bon Marché in\n",
      "Paris, the employers determined that something must be done more than\n",
      "was done in other stores so that every visitor would remember the place\n",
      "with pleasure and come again. The result was the most exquisite\n",
      "politeness ever seen in a mercantile establishment, and it has developed\n",
      "the largest business of its kind in the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9. THE MICROSCOPIC EYE.--The microscope shows a hundred things the naked\n",
      "eye cannot see. Endeavor to see what others fail to see--new\n",
      "possibilities of sales, new means of profit, new methods of doing\n",
      "things. It was by steadily looking at a thing until he saw what was not\n",
      "apparent to the superficial view that Thomas Edison became the greatest\n",
      "electrician of the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10. SCORING A POINT WHEN OFF DUTY.--Do something for your employer when\n",

      "of mankind is man. The greatest college on earth is the business world.\n",
      "The man who can sell the most goods is the one who knows the weaknesses\n",
      "of human nature, and how to avail himself of them. Your best diploma is\n",
      "a big bill of sale. Sell something to everybody--what the customer wants\n",
      "if you have it; if not, what he doesn’t want; but at any rate, sell him\n",
      "something. It is related of a Yankee book-peddler that he sold three\n",

      "he to start anew in business:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12. THE MINIMUM BASIS.--Enumerate the entire number of heads of families\n",
      "in the town, village, ward, or neighborhood where you purpose to begin\n",
      "business. Figure out the number of such persons you will require as a\n",
      "minimum basis in order to get on--that is, how many persons or families,\n",
      "spending each on an average a certain amount per day or week at your\n",
      "place of business, you will require in order to make a living. Do not go\n",
      "blindly into your work, trusting to luck. Luck is always on the side of\n",
      "pluck and tact. Determine what per cent. of the people’s patronage is\n",
      "absolutely essential to your success. The first step is to ascertain if\n",
      "such per cent. is likely to come to you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13. THE HOUSE TO HOUSE CANVASS.--Make a personal canvass from house to\n",
      "house. Do not trust the work to your friend, relative, or clerk. Nobody\n",
      "can help you so much as you can help yourself. Nobody has your interests\n",
      "so much at heart as you have. Tell people pleasantly that you are a new\n",
      "bidder for their patronage. Inform them what you propose to do. Make\n",
      "them to understand that no man shall undersell you, or give them in any\n",
      "way a better bargain. If possible, take a few samples of your choicest\n",
      "goods with you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14. THE CHOICE LOCATION.--If you become popular, the people will come to\n",
      "you; but at first you must go to them. Your place need not be central or\n",
      "on a corner, but it must be where many people pass. Step out largely and\n",
      "conspicuously. You could make no greater mistake than to rent a shabby\n",
      "place on a back street. Have out all manner of signs, curious, newsy,\n",
      "and alluring. Do not think to sustain yourself by people’s sympathies.\n",
      "Men will trade most where they can do best.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15. THE MAXIMUM BASIS.--The maximum basis is the high-water mark. It is\n",
      "the number of persons or families that under the most favorable state of\n",
      "things can be your patrons. All you cannot expect. Kindred, religion,\n",
      "politics, friendships, and secret fraternities, will hold a portion of\n",
      "the community to the old traders. The sharpest rivalry will meet you.\n",
      "Also, you must consider what incursions are likely to be made by\n",
      "out-of-town dealers, and what prospect there is of others setting up\n",
      "business in the place. But you should have an ideal trade toward which\n",
      "you steadily work. Declare daily to yourself, “my gross earnings shall\n",
      "be $--per day,” or “---- (so many) persons shall be my patrons.” When\n",
      "you fall below the mark, bestir yourself in many ways.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16. THE PERSONAL EQUATION.--Remember that you yourself in contact with\n",
      "your customers count for more than anything else. The weather of the\n",
      "face, the temperature of the hand, the color of the voice, will win\n",
      "customers where other means fail. Make your patrons feel that you are\n",
      "their friend. Inquire about members of their family. Be exceedingly\n",
      "polite. Recommend your goods. Mention anything of an especially\n",
      "attractive or meritorious nature you may have. Join the church, the\n",
      "regiment, the fire company, and the secret society. Become “all things\n",
      "to all men, if by any means you can sell to some.” Be everywhere in your\n",
      "place of business. Oversee the smallest details. Trust as little as\n",
      "possible to your clerks. The diamond of success is the master’s eye.\n",
      "Remember there is no fate. There are opportunity, purpose, grit, push,\n",
      "pluck, but no fate. If you fail, do not lay the blame upon\n",
      "circumstances, but upon yourself. Enthusiasm moves stones. You must\n",
      "carry your business in your brain. “A bank never gets to be very\n",
      "successful,” says a noted financier, “until it gets a president who\n",
      "takes it to bed with him.” There was an angel in Michael Angelo’s muddy\n",

      "the people to trade with you, but you must bear in mind that as soon as\n",
      "the influence of one device begins to flag it must be immediately\n",
      "succeeded by another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17. THE INTERLINED ADVERTISEMENT.--Advertisements are not read unless\n",
      "persons are looking for something in that line. This is because they are\n",
      "all placed by themselves. Your bid for patronage must be put in the\n",
      "midst of the reading matter if it is to attract general attention. Many\n",
      "publishers will not do this, but your chief and only point in appearing\n",
      "in the paper is to have your advertisement read, and it pays better to\n",
      "insert it in a journal with 5,000 readers who will all see it than in\n",
      "one having 100,000 subscribers, hardly 100 of whom will glance at the\n",
      "advertisement. You can afford to pay handsomely if the publisher will\n",
      "give you a line of black-faced type to eight or ten lines of news.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18. THE PICTURESQUE NAME.--Have a name for your store such as will\n",
      "easily fit everybody’s mouth. “The Beehive,” “The Blizzard,” “The\n",
      "Buttercup,” or “The Bonanza,” are suggestive titles. Many customers are\n",
      "attracted by the talk of their acquaintances, and it is much easier to\n",
      "tell a friend that you bought an article at “The Hub,” or “The Sun,”\n",
      "than to attempt the unpronounceable name of a proprietor, or to give a\n",
      "forgotten number. Successful men in several lines of business assert\n",
      "that they owe much of their good fortune to the happy hit of a popular\n",
      "name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19. THE PICTORIAL WRECK.--A writer with the gift of a lively imagination\n",
      "can write something interesting in the way of a fanciful battle between\n",
      "customers and goods. Head lines, “Great Slaughter in ---- (the taking\n",
      "name of your store),” “Wreck of Old Conservatism,” “Smash of High\n",
      "Prices,” “Ruined by the Rush.” Then would follow a graphic description\n",
      "of the charge of customers upon wares in which the store was almost\n",
      "wrecked by the enormous number of people who took advantage of the\n",
      "under-cost prices. People enjoy this kind of pleasantry, and the impulse\n",
      "to follow the crowd is almost irresistible. A certain New York house\n",
      "grew from a small to a great one by this method of advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20. RED LETTER DAY.--Have a day in which you offer special bargains to\n",
      "the people of a certain town, village or hamlet. Put up flaming posters,\n",
      "announcing “Squashville day,” “Jonesboro Day,” “Bloomington day.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21. CLASS DISCOUNT.--You may draw numbers of men to your place by this\n",
      "means. Secret fraternities, workingmen’s orders, church societies,\n",
      "wheelmen’s leagues, will be attracted to you if they know you specially\n",
      "favor them. Fortunes have been made by close attention to these great\n",
      "organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22. THE HONEST FLAW.--Strictly instruct your clerks to tell your\n",
      "customers the precise nature of every article; if the quality is\n",
      "inferior, make them to understand exactly what they are getting for\n",
      "their money; and if there be a flaw, let them be careful to point it\n",
      "out. By such means thousands of people who cannot trust their own\n",
      "judgment in these matters, will be attracted to a place where they are\n",
      "certain to be treated fairly. A. T. Stewart, who began business in a\n",
      "modest store, and who, in the latter part of his life sold $20,000,000\n",
      "worth of goods every year, declared that this plan was the keynote of\n",
      "his success.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23. THE PREMIUM CLERK.--You need clerks who can induce acquaintances to\n",
      "visit your store, cajole visitors into customers, and coax customers to\n",
      "become larger buyers. If you have a number of clerks and your business\n",
      "will admit of it, offer a monthly premium to the one who brings into the\n",
      "store the largest number of new buyers or into the cash-drawer the\n",
      "heaviest receipts. There are certain kinds of business where this plan\n",
      "will work, and will be provocative of such competition as greatly to\n",
      "increase trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "24. THE RAILROAD MILEAGE.--Arrange, if possible, with some railroad\n",
      "company to issue mileage tickets as premiums to those who will trade\n",
      "with you. At two cents a mile you could afford to give two miles of\n",
      "travel for every one dollar’s worth of goods. At that rate $500 worth of\n",
      "goods would buy a $20 mileage ticket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25. THE DIAL DOLLARS.--How many figures on the dial of your watch?\n",
      "Twenty-eight, counting the number VI, which is generally either omitted\n",
      "or only partly indicated. Fix a big dial two feet or more in diameter in\n",
      "some prominent part of your store, and announce that when a customer has\n",
      "traded an amount equal to the total figures on the dial you will present\n",
      "him with a watch. Of course, the timepiece would be a very cheap one,\n",
      "but many a parent will trade with you for the sake of getting a watch\n",
      "for his child.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26. FIRST CUSTOMER PACKAGE.--In some periods of the day you will have\n",
      "more custom than you can well attend to, while at other times you will\n",
      "have nothing to do. The following plan will perhaps help to equalize\n",
      "trade, and also give you additional buyers: Suspend a package in some\n",
      "conspicuous part of your store with the announcement thereon that it\n",
      "will be given free to the first customer in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27. THE CARPET COUPON.--By a system of large-sized coupons--we will say\n",
      "a foot square--you can put into practice a unique system that will\n",
      "appeal to the heart of every housewife. Publish that you will give a\n",
      "free carpet of a certain size and grade when a fixed amount has been\n",
      "traded. A square foot of a coupon represents a sum of money spent in the\n",
      "store--perhaps one dollar. Every woman by measuring her room can learn\n",
      "how many dollars’ worth of goods she must buy before she can have a free\n",
      "carpet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "28. THE HOUSE LOT COUPON.--This is an extension of carpet coupon. A\n",
      "certain amount of purchased goods entitles one to a building lot, which,\n",
      "if in the country, need not be of great cost. Have the particular lots\n",
      "selected and advertised. Another plan is to offer the lot to the largest\n",
      "purchaser within a certain time--possibly five years. This is a good way\n",
      "to hold on to customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29. PRICE-TIME GRADE.--If you have the credit system, have also a\n",
      "gradation of prices so as to encourage people to pay at the earliest\n",
      "possible time. A system like this would do--forty days full price;\n",
      "thirty days, two per cent. off; twenty days, three per cent. off; ten\n",
      "days, four per cent. off; cash, five per cent. off.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30. SALES BULLETIN.--People like to buy where others buy. Success brings\n",
      "success. If you are doing well, you may do better. Have a large bulletin\n",
      "board in front of your store, or near it, announcing your sales for the\n",
      "past week. Newspapers boom themselves in like manner by publishing their\n",
      "enormous circulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "31. BEST REASON PRIZE.--Offer a prize to the one who will give the best\n",
      "reason for trading at Push & Pluck’s, and then insert in the form of an\n",
      "advertisement in a leading paper a list of the best reasons. Six months\n",
      "before Christmas offer presents to all who will trade a certain amount\n",
      "before that holiday.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "32. BIRTHDAY CALENDAR.--A calendar with the birthdays of your customers\n",
      "(age of course omitted), would attract attention, and the offer to give\n",
      "a present to any one trading a certain amount before his birthday would\n",
      "certainly add to your receipts.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33. CONSPICUOUS PRICE-LIST.--Buyers are caught like fish. Display in\n",
      "your window a list of cut prices. Passers-by who cannot resist the\n",
      "opportunity of a bargain will come in, and often be induced to purchase\n",
      "the goods which are not reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34. THE EARLY DISCOUNT.--In order to equalize the trade of the day\n",
      "announce that you will give a slight discount to persons trading during\n",
      "the dull hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35. THE MONEY-SPACE COUNTER.--Determine that every portion of your store\n",
      "shall pay. Have every lineal foot of your counters calculated at a\n",
      "certain rate of profit. If you find a department that does not pay,\n",
      "change methods or your goods, and if still unsuccessful drop it. Many\n",
      "large dealers fail because they keep departments where the expenses are\n",
      "more than the profits. But if every foot of room pays only a little, the\n",
      "entire store must pay handsomely.\n",
      "\n",
      "It will be seen in the foregoing how every leading impulse in human\n",
      "nature is appealed to--curiosity and cupidity, honesty and economy,\n",
      "personal flattery and local pride. If, in addition to these powerful\n",
      "inducements to patronage, you combine shrewdness in buying and\n",
      "cautiousness in trusting, if your goods are excellent in quality and\n",
      "generous in quantity, if your place of business is neat and attractive,\n",
      "and your service marked by promptness and politeness; then it is\n",
      "impossible to fail; you have all the elements of prosperity, and are\n",

      "advertised its purchasers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37. THE TOY IMITATION.--Wooden nutmegs and shoe-peg oats have duly\n",
      "advertised the shrewd ways of the people of Connecticut. A man recently\n",
      "made a hit by the “imitation cigar,” which is only a piece of wood of\n",
      "the shape and color of a cigar. Every boy wants one. As an advertising\n",
      "medium it was an immense success. Think of something as common and cheap\n",
      "as a cigar, get up an imitation for the children, have your enterprise\n",
      "stamped upon it, and it will go from one end of the land to the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38. THE CARTOON.--A caricature of some political person or situation is\n",
      "always taking. Hit off some social craze, or give a witty representation\n",
      "of some matter of passing interest. Drops of ink in this way are seeds\n",
      "of gold, and the harvest will be golden.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39. THE CONJURER.--This is a good way to advertise when the article is a\n",
      "cheap affair which can be shown in the street. There are few things so\n",
      "attractive to the masses as the tricks of the sleight-of-hand performer.\n",

      "in a few days’ practice you can acquire enough of the art for your\n",
      "purpose. You can draw a crowd wherever there are people. When you have\n",

      "40. THE STRIKING FIGURE.--If your goods are on sale in some prominent\n",
      "store, this device is sure to draw attention. Make a figure of some\n",
      "animal or vegetable or other form, if your article will lend itself to\n",
      "such a work. The figure could be some prominent man, or represent an\n",
      "historic scene, or illustrate some popular movement. A dealer in\n",
      "confectionery had in his window a bicycle made all of candy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41. THE ADVERTISING STORY.--Offer a prize to the one who will write the\n",
      "best story about the merits of your article. The latter must be brought\n",
      "deftly into the story, and the award should be based upon the merits of\n",
      "the literary production and the skill in the use of the advertisement.\n",
      "Every competitor should be required to buy a small number of the\n",
      "articles, and the story should be published.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42. THE WORD-BUILDER.--Another prize might be offered to the one who\n",
      "could compose the greatest number of words from the name of your article\n",
      "or invention. The name ought to include at least a dozen letters, and\n",
      "there should be a set of rules for building words. Every contestant must\n",
      "buy your invention from whose title he is to build words.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43. THE POPULAR PUN.--This is an expensive way of advertising, but an\n",
      "immensely paying one. You make a pun upon some fad of the day, a hit\n",
      "upon some general craze, a piercing of some passing bubble, a political\n",
      "quib. Something of this nature printed several times in the issue of the\n",
      "daily papers would make your venture known to everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "44. THE POLITICAL GUESSER.--If your enterprise admits of the coupon\n",
      "system, offer a prize to the one who will guess the successful candidate\n",
      "at the next election, and come the nearest to the figures of his\n",
      "plurality. The contestant must purchase one of your articles, and in\n",
      "this way hundreds of thousands may be sold. Every presidential election\n",
      "is the occasion of the floating of many things by this scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45. THE GEOMETRICAL GROUP.--Some wares, such as fancy soaps and canned\n",
      "goods, admit of a grouping which is very attractive to the eye.\n",
      "Pyramids, cones, circles, and towers, always draw attention. Some\n",
      "mechanical device whereby motion is produced will be sure to draw a\n",
      "crowd to your show window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46. THE PICTORIAL COMPARISON.--If you are sure of your ground, draw a\n",
      "diagram or other figure, comparing your staple with those of others in\n",
      "the market. In this way the Royal Baking Powder Company pushed to the\n",
      "front, comparing with heavy black lines its product with the outputs of\n",
      "other companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "47. THE OPEN CHALLENGE.--And if you are still further confident that you\n",
      "have the best thing of its kind, you may issue a challenge to your\n",
      "competitors. Make it apparent that you are anxious, even clamorous, for\n",
      "a trial of your product against others. By this means you will establish\n",
      "yourself in the confidence of the public. The Remington Typewriter was\n",
      "boomed in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48. THE BOOK GIFT.--Try the religious field. Issue leaflets or tiny\n",
      "books with paper covers, costing not more than two or three dollars a\n",
      "thousand, and offer them as gifts to Sunday-schools or other children’s\n",
      "organization. Most Sunday-school superintendents would be glad to give\n",
      "away booklets of this kind if they could be obtained free of charge. The\n",
      "books should contain a bright story, a few pictures, and, of course, a\n",
      "taking presentation of your wares.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "49. SUNDAY-SCHOOL SUPPLIES.--In some cases, you might even be warranted\n",
      "in issuing the supplies of a Sunday school, at least for a portion of\n",
      "the year. The books in the last number might not in every case be read,\n",
      "but the picture papers, lesson leaves, and other helps, are all looked\n",
      "over, even if not studied. You could in many cases present them,\n",
      "reserving large advertising space for yourself so as to net a good\n",
      "profit. The class of customers thus obtained would be the very best. Do\n",
      "not hope for large returns unless you are willing to spend money. Money\n",
      "is the manure that creates crops, the blood that makes fatness, the wind\n",
      "that fans fortune, the sap that runs into golden fruit. Money is the\n",
      "bread on the waters that “returneth after many days.” It seems like the\n",
      "sheerest folly to spend so much in advertising, but you cannot reap\n",
      "bountifully unless you sow bountifully. “For every dollar spent in\n",
      "advertising,” declares a successful merchant, “I have reaped five.”\n",

      "your sales at first are small, you can put in your spare time in the\n",
      "making of your goods, and afterward as your custom increases you can\n",

      "_Section I. Household Ornaments._\n",
      "\n",
      "A home may be rendered attractive by a few simple ornaments that are\n",
      "very cheap. Vines, grasses, etc., add touches of beauty to a home and\n",
      "cost very little. Few people know how to prepare these little\n",
      "curiosities, and many would esteem it too much trouble to get and\n",
      "arrange the material if they did know. But most of these persons would\n",
      "buy them if the materials were prepared, and the vines, etc., ready to\n",
      "grow. You must have models of each kind in full growth in order to\n",
      "excite their admiration, and then you must have others in the initial\n",
      "stage for sale. Take pains to show the models, and explain the method of\n",
      "treating the plants and vines. The following cost little, and can be\n",
      "sold for from 300 to 500 per cent. profit. Some of your patrons will\n",
      "prefer to buy the models outright, and others to grow them themselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "50. CRYSTALLIZED GRASSES.--Put in water as much alum as can be\n",
      "dissolved. Pour into an earthen jar and boil slowly until evaporated\n",
      "nearly one half. Suspend the grasses in such a manner that their tops\n",
      "will be under the solution. Put the whole in a cool place where not the\n",
      "least draught of air will disturb the formation of crystals. In\n",
      "twenty-four to thirty-six hours take out the grasses, and let them\n",
      "harden in a cool room. For blue crystals, prepare blue vitriol or\n",
      "sulphate of copper in the same manner. Gold crystals can be produced by\n",
      "adding tumeric to the alum solution, and purple crystals by a few drops\n",
      "of extract of logwood. Sell them at twenty-five cents a bunch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "51. LEAF IMPRESSIONS.--Hold oiled paper in the smoke of a lamp, or of\n",
      "pitch, until it becomes coated with smoke. Then take a perfect leaf,\n",
      "having a pretty outline, and after warming it between the hands, lay\n",
      "the leaf upon the smoked side of the paper, with the under side down,\n",
      "press it evenly upon the paper so that every part may come in contact,\n",
      "go over it lightly with a rolling-pin, then remove the leaf with care to\n",
      "a piece of white paper, and use the rolling-pin again. You will then\n",
      "have a beautiful impression of the delicate veins and outline of the\n",
      "leaf. A sheet containing a dozen such leaves should bring you\n",
      "twenty-five cents; if arranged in a pretty white album, with a different\n",
      "kind of leaf for every page, the selling price should not be less than\n",
      "one dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "52. VINE AND TRELLIS.--Put a sweet potato in a tumbler of water, or any\n",
      "similar glass vessel; let the lower end of the tuber be about two inches\n",
      "from the bottom of the vessel; keep on the mantel shelf, and sun it for\n",
      "an hour or two each day. Soon the “eyes” of the potato will throw up a\n",
      "pretty vine. Now with some small sticks or coarse splints construct a\n",
      "tiny trellis, which, if placed in the window, will soon find a customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "53. THE SUSPENDED ACORN.--Suspend an acorn by a piece of thread, within\n",
      "half an inch of the surface of some water contained in a vase, tumbler\n",
      "or saucer, and allow it to remain undisturbed for several weeks. It will\n",
      "soon burst open, and small roots will seek the water; a straight and\n",
      "tapering stem, with beautiful, glossy green leaves, will shoot upward,\n",
      "and present a very pleasing appearance. Supply water of the same warmth\n",
      "once a month, and add bits of charcoal to keep it from souring. If the\n",
      "leaves turn yellow, put a drop of ammonia into the water, and it will\n",
      "renew their luxuriance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "54. MOSS AND CONE.--Take a saucer and fill it with fresh green moss.\n",
      "Place in the center a large pine cone, having first wet it thoroughly.\n",
      "Then sprinkle it with grass seed. The moisture will close the cone\n",
      "partially, and in a day or two tiny grass spears will appear in the\n",
      "interstices, and in a week you will have a perfect cone covered with\n",
      "graceful verdure. The advantage of this, as well as of the other pretty\n",
      "things in this section, is that they are fresh and green in the midst of\n",
      "winter, and people are attracted to the slice of spring in your window\n",
      "when the outside world is mantled with snow.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "55. THE TUMBLER OF PEAS.--Take a common tumbler or fruit can and fill it\n",
      "nearly full of soft water. Tie a bit of coarse lace or cheese-sacking\n",
      "over it, and covering it with a layer of peas, press down into the\n",
      "water. In a few days the peas will sprout, the little thread-like roots\n",
      "going down through the lace into the water, while the vines can be\n",
      "trained upon a pretty little frame.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "56. THE HANGING TURNIP.--Take a large turnip and scrape out the inside,\n",
      "leaving a thick wall all around. Fill the cavity with earth, and plant\n",
      "in it some clinging vine or morning glory. Suspend the turnip with\n",
      "cords, and in a little time the vines will twine around the strings, and\n",
      "the turnip, sprouting from below, will put forth leaves and stems that\n",
      "will turn upward and gracefully curl around the base.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "57. BLEACHED LEAVES.--Mix one drachm chloride of lime with one pint of\n",
      "water, and add sufficient acetic acid to liberate the chlorine. Steep\n",
      "the leaves about ten minutes, or until they are whitened. Remove them on\n",
      "a piece of paper and wash them in clean water. They are now ready for\n",
      "sale, and all you need do is to arrange a dozen of them on a sheet of\n",
      "black paper, or in a dark-colored album, and expose them in your show\n",
      "window.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "58. THE ARTIFICIAL PLANT.--Take the glossy silk stuff known as taffeta.\n",
      "Dye the piece the proper green color before cutting. After it is dried,\n",
      "prepare with gum arabic on one side to represent the glossy surface of\n",
      "the leaves, and with starch on the other to give the velvety appearance\n",
      "of the under side. Use a fine goffering tool to make the veins and\n",
      "indentations. Glue the leaves to the stem, and place to advantage in\n",
      "your store window, where, if you have been skillful, they can hardly be\n",
      "distinguished from the leaves of a growing plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are moderately successful, procure a book about household\n",
      "ornaments and artificial plants, and you will learn to make many more\n",
      "designs. We have selected these because they are the cheapest and most\n",
      "easily made. All the above, except the albums, should sell for\n",
      "twenty-five cents. Remember that a great deal depends upon your taste in\n",
      "arranging, your manner of explaining, and your adroitness in\n",
      "recommending. You must be so in love with your plants as to be\n",
      "enthusiastic. In general, a lady succeeds in this work better than a\n",
      "gentleman.\n",

      "_Section 2. Tea Dishes._\n",
      "\n",
      "At almost no cost, you find yourself established in the midst of dozens\n",
      "of clinging vines and pretty plants. Now for the next step. Have a few\n",
      "appetizing tea-dishes in your window. Put out a sign, telling people\n",
      "that you will have every night certain fine and fresh table delicacies\n",
      "on sale. The effect of dainty dishes in close proximity to graceful\n",
      "vines is exceedingly tempting to the appetite.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "59. DELICIOUS HAM.--If very neat, you can sell to many families cold\n",
      "boiled ham for supper or lunch. Put the ham in cold water, and simmer\n",
      "gently five hours. Set the kettle aside, and when nearly cold draw off\n",
      "the skin of the ham and cover with cracker crumbs and about three\n",
      "tablespoonfuls of sugar. Place in the oven in a baking pan for thirty or\n",
      "forty minutes. When cold, slice thin and lay temptingly on large white\n",
      "plates. Cost of a ham weighing ten pounds, $1.20. Sales at thirty cents\n",
      "a pound, $3.00. Deduct for shrinkage in boiling and waste in trimming\n",
      "one and one-half pounds, forty-five cents. Profits, $1.35.\n",

      "60. CHOICE TONGUE.--If successful with ham, you can try a little tongue.\n",
      "Soak over night and cook for four or five hours. Throw into cold water\n",
      "and peel off the skin. Cut evenly and arrange attractively on plates,\n",
      "garnishing with sprigs of parsley. Cooked meats should be placed in the\n",
      "show window under transparent gauze. In hot weather a cake of ice\n",
      "beneath will greatly tempt the appetite of the passer-by.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "61. ARTIFICIAL HONEY.--Where honey is high priced, make the following:\n",
      "Five pounds white sugar, two pounds water, gradually bring to a boil,\n",
      "and skim well. When cool, add one pound bees’ honey and four drops of\n",
      "peppermint. There is a large profit in this where the customer is not\n",
      "particular about the quality; but if a better article is desired add\n",
      "less water and more real honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can add a number of other tea-dishes as you learn what will sell. A\n",
      "thing that is salable in one community is often not so in another. You\n",
      "must be guided by the taste of the locality, and when a dish does not\n",
      "sell well try another.\n",

      "_Section 3. Pastry._\n",
      "\n",
      "Suppose you now try a little pastry. If you can make a superior article,\n",
      "you will have a ready sale, but it is often difficult to introduce the\n",
      "goods. It is sometimes a good plan to donate a cake to a fair, cutting\n",
      "the loaf into very thin slices, and giving them to leading ladies who\n",
      "may be present, superintending the matter yourself, and advertising that\n",
      "you will take orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "62. ANGEL CAKE.--The whites of eleven eggs, one and a half cupfuls of\n",
      "granulated sugar, measured after being sifted four times, one cupful of\n",
      "flour measured after being sifted four times, one teaspoonful of cream\n",
      "tartar, and one of vanilla extract. Beat the whites to a stiff froth and\n",
      "beat the sugar into the eggs. Add the seasoning and flour, stirring\n",
      "quickly and lightly. Beat until ready to put the mixture into the oven.\n",
      "Use a pan that has little legs on the top comers so that when the pan is\n",
      "turned upside down on the table after the baking, a current of air will\n",
      "pass under and over it. Bake for forty minutes in a moderate oven. Do\n",
      "not grease the pan. This cake should sell for $1, or, cut in twenty\n",
      "pieces, at five cents each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "63. DOMINOS.--If you are located near a schoolhouse or on a street where\n",
      "many children pass, you can do a big business in dominos. Bake a sponge\n",
      "cake in a rather thin sheet. Cut into small oblong pieces the shape of a\n",
      "domino. Frost the top and sides. When the frosting is hard, draw the\n",
      "black lines and make the dots with a small brush that has been dipped in\n",
      "melted chocolate. They will sell “like hot cakes.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "64. SOFT GINGERBREAD.--All children like this. Here is an excellent\n",
      "kind: Six cupfuls of flour, three of molasses, one of cream, one of lard\n",
      "or butter, two eggs, one teaspoonful of saleratus, and two of ginger.\n",
      "You can sell this, when light and warm, almost as fast as you can make\n",
      "it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "65. DOUGHNUTS.--These, too, are tempting to children. Four eggs, one\n",
      "half-pound sugar, two ounces butter, one pound flour, boiled milk,\n",
      "nutmeg, cinnamon, and a few drops of some essence. Beat the eggs and\n",
      "sugar and melt the butter and stir it in; then add a pound of flour and\n",
      "enough boiled milk to make a rather stiff dough; flavor with nutmeg,\n",
      "cinnamon, and a few drops of some essence; cut into shapes with tumbler\n",
      "or knife, and fry brown in hot lard. When done, sift on fine sugar. Made\n",
      "fresh every day and placed temptingly in the window, they will sell\n",
      "fast.\n",

      "After you are well established, you should sell at least two dozen\n",
      "doughtnuts at a profit of a penny apiece, two cards of gingerbread at\n",
      "seven cents profit each, and three dozen dominos at a profit of five\n",
      "cents a dozen. Total profit per day on three last articles in this\n",

      "\n",
      "If you find that children are your best customers, you may cater yet\n",
      "further to their taste. Remember that your success depends upon your\n",
      "keeping choice articles. It is surprising how children find out the best\n",
      "candy stores, and how quick they are to discern between good and bad\n",
      "stock. By making your own goods, you can sell a little cheaper than the\n",
      "dealers who have to buy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "66. WALNUT CANDY.--This is something which all children like. Put the\n",
      "meats of the nuts on the bottom of tins previously greased to the depth\n",
      "of half an inch. Boil two pounds of brown sugar, one half pint of water,\n",
      "and one gill of molasses, until a portion of the mass hardens when it\n",
      "cools. Pour the hot candy on the meats and allow it to remain until\n",
      "hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "67. CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.--A favorite with girls. Boil a quart of best\n",
      "molasses until it hardens when put in water. Before removing from the\n",
      "fire, add four ounces of fine chocolate. Pour a thin layer into tin\n",
      "trays slightly greased. When it hardens a little cut into squares. You\n",
      "can sell these as low as thirty cents a pound, and still make a good\n",
      "profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "68. PEPPERMINT CREAMS.--Take one pound of sugar, seven teaspoonfuls of\n",
      "water, and one teaspoonful of essence of peppermint. Work together into\n",
      "a stiff paste, roll, cut, and stamp with a little wooden stamp such as\n",
      "are bought for individual butter pats.\n",

      "pounds of white sugar, one pint of sugar-house syrup, and one pint of\n",
      "best molasses. Boil together until the mass hardens when dropped in cold\n",
      "water, and work in the usual manner. Sell by the stick, or in broken\n",
      "pieces by the pound, half, and quarter.\n",
      "\n",

      "nothing. You can sell it at five cents a bottle.\n",
      "\n",

      "148. POP CORN.--Use a large popper, and when the corn comes out white\n",
      "and hot, add a little molasses to make it adhere, and flavor with some\n",
      "popular extract. Mold it in balls, rectangles, or in any other fancy\n",

      "of land. Having a fondness for plants, I cultivated them in curious\n",
      "ways, while keeping my little family together by taking in sewing. One\n",
      "day a lady who was spending the summer in T---- called and inquired what\n",
      "I would take for a pea vine which was growing in a tumbler of water. I\n",
      "was surprised, as I had not thought of making merchandise of my plant\n",
      "pets. She purchased a number of pretty little odd things of vegetable\n",
      "life with which I had amused myself, and suggested that I might earn\n",
      "something by cultivating rare forms of plants. It was a new idea to me.\n",
      "I had not thought there was any money in what had been to me only a\n",
      "pastime, but I increased the number of my plant curiosities, and the\n",
      "lady and her friends bought them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then my friend said to me, ‘Why don’t you keep a Home Store? You have\n",
      "so much taste I think you would do nicely?’ ‘And pray what is a Home\n",
      "Store?’ I inquired. ‘Oh, it’s a store where the things are all made at\n",
      "home.’ ‘But I have no capital.’ ‘You need no capital. See, the things\n",
      "are all made at home. Begin with a few tea dishes.’ So I bought a ham,\n",
      "sliced it thin, and laid some sprigs of parsley around it. I also made\n",
      "some artificial honey from a recipe in an old cook book. With the money\n",
      "I thus earned, I had my window enlarged into a show-window, and put in\n",
      "a variety of vegetables from my garden, taking care they should be\n",
      "strictly fresh every day. I had such success that, at the suggestion of\n",
      "my lady patron, I began to make a great many other things--pastry,\n",
      "preserves, sweetmeats, and toilet articles. I also purchased one hundred\n",
      "fowls, and served my customers with fresh eggs. My trade grew so that I\n",
      "decided to have a real store, and so, at an expense of about $50, I had\n",
      "my two front rooms made into one and fitted up with shelves and\n",
      "counters. I purchased a cow and a pig on credit, and also two or three\n",
      "hives of bees. The people seemed to appreciate my fresh eggs, milk,\n",
      "butter and honey, and I soon paid all my debts and branched out in\n",
      "several other directions in the way of homemade goods. Hitherto, my\n",

      "necessary to employ a cheap male laborer to look after my garden,\n",
      "orchard, cow, pig, and poultry, as well as to assist in making some of\n",
      "my goods. I made a great variety of things as new suggestions came to me\n",

      "There are multitudes of people who have a single acre of ground which\n",
      "could be made to yield much profit if they knew how to handle it. Others\n",
      "have an half or a quarter of an acre; not enough, perhaps, to give them\n",
      "a support, but which would add very materially to their income if\n",
      "properly cultivated. In this chapter we tell you what to do with the\n",
      "“home acre,” with examples of what others have done with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "149. MONEY IN PEARS.--Do you know that one acre of the best yielding\n",
      "pear trees will bring more profit than a five-hundred acre farm without\n",
      "a twentieth of the care or capital?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "150. GREENBACKS IN GREENINGS.--It is a fact that forty apple trees of\n",
      "the R. H. Greening variety on a single acre have yielded a crop worth\n",
      "$400.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "151. PLUMS OF GOLD.--A widow has in her garden twelve plum trees from\n",
      "which she regularly receives $60 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "152. THE RASPBERRY ACRE.--“There are repeated instances of $400 and\n",
      "even $600 being made clear from a single acre of raspberries.” See\n",
      "Morris’ “Ten Acres Enough.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "153. PROFITS IN BIG PEACHES.--When ordinary peaches were selling at 25\n",
      "cents a bushel, a grower received $2 a bushel. This is how he did it.\n",
      "When the fruit was as large as a hickory nut, he employed a large force\n",
      "of laborers and picked off more than one-half the fruit. The rest\n",
      "ripened early, grew large, and were of excellent quality. His net profit\n",
      "that year from eleven acres was between $3,000 and $4,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "154. EASY TOMATOES.--An easy crop, requiring little care. Says a grower\n",
      "in New Jersey: “My single acre of tomatoes netted a clear profit of\n",
      "$120. I am aware that others have realized more than double this sum,\n",
      "but they were experienced hands, while I was new to the business.” Four\n",
      "hundred dollars per acre has frequently been realized from this crop.\n",
      "One person had four acres from which he received from $1,500 to $2,000\n",
      "annually.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "155. ASSORTED STRAWBERRIES.--Here is the experience of a novice: “I ran\n",
      "a ditch through my wet and almost worthless meadow land, and set it out\n",
      "with strawberry plants. The second year I had an enormous crop. The\n",
      "larger berries were separated from the smaller, and the show thus made\n",
      "by the assorted fruit was magnificent. For 600 quarts I received $300,\n",
      "it being a little early for strawberries in the New York market.” It\n",
      "pays to grow early and large fruit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "156. LIVINGS IN LETTUCE.--Fifteen thousand heads can be set upon an\n",
      "acre. These at the average price of $1.50 per hundred means $225 per\n",
      "acre. Five acres of this crop should give a fair-sized family a good\n",
      "living. It is an auxiliary crop and may be sowed between heads of\n",
      "cabbage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "157. SOVEREIGNS IN SPINACH.--There are few more important crops in\n",
      "market. It requires little labor, can be cultivated evenings and\n",
      "mornings by a busy man, and pays about $75 an acre.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "158. THOUSAND-DOLLAR CELERY.--Celery may be grown as a second crop after\n",
      "beets, onions, or peas are cleared up. A little reckoning in the number\n",
      "of heads per acre shows that if the grower could get the consumer’s\n",
      "price of eight or ten cents a head, it would yield a clear profit of\n",
      "$1,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "159. FORTUNES IN WATER-CRESS.--“I have no doubt,” says a large grower,\n",
      "“that in situations where irrigation could be used at pleasure, or\n",
      "regular plantations made as for cranberries, judging from the enormous\n",
      "price water-cress sells at, picked as it is in the present haphazard\n",
      "way, an acre would sell for $4,000 or $5,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "160. THE DOLLAR BLACKBERRY.--When the Lawton first came out, so great\n",
      "was the praise of it and the rush to obtain it that many roots were sent\n",
      "through the mail at $1 apiece, and the lucky discoverer netted a small\n",
      "fortune. But any grower has the same chances to discover a new variety,\n",
      "or to improve on his present stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "161. NICKELS IN PICKLES.--Do you know that the enormous number of\n",
      "150,000 cucumbers may be easily grown on an acre of land, and that at\n",
      "the low price of $1.50 per thousand this means $225 per acre? The crop\n",
      "also is very easily raised.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "162. THE BEET LOT.--You can grow 80,000 roots per acre even when sown a\n",
      "foot apart, yet at $1 per hundred, deducting one-half for expenses,\n",
      "there still results a net value of $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "163. THE ROASTING EAR.--You can plant an acre of sweet corn, realize\n",
      "$100 for it, clear it off in August, sow the cleared ground with turnip\n",
      "seed, and from the second crop reap another $100.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "164. PAYING PEAS.--They are the early kind, marketed before the price\n",
      "falls. If grown under glass so as to be crowded on the market in early\n",
      "June, they will bring $4 a bushel, and at that rate an acre will mean\n",
      "$400. If delayed a month, they will not bring a quarter of that sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "165. GRATED HORSERADISH.--The root is very easily raised, requires\n",
      "little cultivation, but is quite profitable. Grate finely and put in\n",
      "attractive white bottles with red labels. Give it some fancy name, as\n",
      "“Red Orchard,” or “Spring Valley.” “Little Neck” clams got their\n",
      "reputation largely in this way. Sell for ten cents a bottle.\n",

      "The field of woman’s work has been vastly augmented during the last\n",
      "half-century. From school teaching and dressmaking, which were about the\n",
      "only occupations open to our grandmothers, the number of ways a woman\n",
      "can make a living have increased to over two hundred. To be exact, there\n",
      "are two hundred and twenty-one occupations open to women, out of a total\n",
      "of two hundred and fifty. It is the design of the author to give only\n",
      "those methods which are unique, unusual, and presumably unknown to most\n",
      "lady readers. In a few cases these money-making methods must be\n",
      "considered as only tributary to a larger source of revenue, as when a\n",
      "salaried position or business enterprise is not sufficient for a\n",
      "support, or when a woman wishes to help the family “eke out a living,”\n",
      "but in most cases it is expected that the suggestions if followed will\n",
      "be an adequate source of income. Several of these ways may often be\n",
      "united where one is insufficient. There is no need for any woman to\n",
      "marry for the sake of a home. The examples given will enable any lady\n",
      "of the least tact, skill, or enterprise, to secure an independent\n",
      "living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "166. THE SCHOOL STORE.--If you live near a public school, a small store\n",
      "containing candies, school supplies and knickknacks for the children\n",
      "will be found to bring much profit. The store need not be large or\n",
      "conspicuous. A room in a private house will do. Children, like bees, are\n",
      "all fond of sweets. The store need be open only for an hour in the\n",
      "morning, or noon, and at the close of school, so that other work may be\n",
      "carried on at the same time. A dressmaker, with hours arranged so as not\n",
      "to conflict, could combine very well these two ways of earning a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "167. THE HAND ALBUM.--Have an album made in usual style, except that the\n",
      "places for pictures are omitted. Smear each page with soft wax to the\n",
      "depth of one-sixth of an inch. When a friend calls, slightly heat a page\n",
      "and request him to lay his hands, palms down, upon it. In that way you\n",
      "can preserve the digits of your friends, and you will be surprised to\n",
      "find there is as much difference in hands as in faces. When your album\n",
      "is full, if you choose you can consult a patent lawyer, and arrange to\n",
      "protect your invention. A novelty of this kind would doubtless be\n",
      "immensely popular, and enable the author to reap a financial harvest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "168. THE NOVELTY BAKERY.--A woman who knows how to make tempting\n",
      "creations in flour can make a good living. Begin by taking your goods to\n",
      "the Woman’s Exchange, of which almost every large city has at least one.\n",
      "If your baking is novel, from the Exchange will come demands from\n",
      "private customers, and even orders from hotels. A New England woman,\n",
      "beginning in a small way, in a few months had an income of $33 per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "169. THE FRONT YARD SNAP.--With a photographer’s outfit, go through the\n",
      "better class residential sections of a city or town and take the\n",
      "pictures of the children which you will see in every street, and in\n",
      "almost every front yard. Get a child in a most striking position, on a\n",
      "wheel, or in a swing or hammock, or at play. Secure parent’s consent to\n",
      "take the picture. No matter if they declare that they will not purchase,\n",
      "they will yield when they see a pretty picture of their child. Much\n",
      "money can be made at this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "170. THE PET DOG.--Do you know that pet dogs often bring enormous\n",
      "prices? You want the Yorkshire terriers, or the King Charles spaniels,\n",
      "or some of the rare Japanese breeds. A lady in New York counts on $500\n",
      "yearly as the income from the families raised from one dog, a King\n",
      "Charles spaniel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "171. THE BOX LUNCH.--There is a large field for some one to cultivate in\n",
      "our great office buildings and factories. Thousands would pay for a\n",
      "light lunch which costs five cents, and is sold for ten cents. Rent a\n",
      "small room near a business center. Make known your occupation. Go\n",
      "through the places of business if possible, or if not take a stand near\n",
      "the door, and if your lunch is tastefully arranged, it will find many\n",
      "buyers. After a time you will get regular customers. Profits 100 per\n",
      "cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "172. THE HAIR-DRESSER.--A refined business for women is the dressing of\n",
      "hair. For $25 you can learn the business. Place samples of all kinds of\n",
      "bangs and switches in the window. They can be sold for a great profit,\n",
      "and if industrious, you can build up in a good neighborhood an excellent\n",
      "paying business, and best of all, it can be done in your own home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "173. TYPO AND STENO.--In many large cities typewriting and stenography\n",
      "may be learned in the Y. W. C. A. Then with a machine and a rented room\n",
      "cheaply furnished a woman is all ready for business. Many women are\n",
      "making $25 per week. One enterprising young lady takes dictated matter\n",
      "in short hand, and then typewrites it at her leisure, thus saving much\n",
      "time to her busy patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "174. THE SEWING SCHOOL.--Here is a vast unworked field. If you\n",
      "understand needlework, and have a little business enterprise, you are\n",
      "certain to succeed. Advertise in the papers and get out circulars,\n",
      "stating that for the small sum of twenty-five cents per week you will\n",
      "teach all pupils plain and fancy sewing. Form your pupils into classes,\n",
      "and if you are gentle and patient, as well as skillful at the needle,\n",
      "you will in a short time have the work which mothers are glad to get rid\n",
      "of. And it can all be done in your own home.\n",

      "\n",
      "175. FLAT HUNTING.--Rent a small office and advertise that for a\n",
      "trifling fee you will exactly suit persons looking for homes, and save\n",
      "them all the trouble. Three or four hours a day are spent in\n",
      "house-hunting, and two in the office. You must have a book with your\n",
      "customers’ demands set down in detail, and another book with a careful\n",
      "description of each house to let. A commission might be exacted from\n",
      "both owner and renter. An enterprising woman could in a short time\n",
      "build up a large business in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "176. A TEA ROOM.--Hire a counter in a fashionable store much frequented\n",
      "by ladies. Have a sign that fresh tea is sold here, made to order with\n",
      "good cream. Small accessories may be fresh rolls, toasted crumpets,\n",
      "bread and butter, and other light articles of food. Ladies weary with\n",
      "shopping will surely come to your counter to be refreshed. A lady in one\n",
      "of our large cities made a fortune by this means. The requirements are\n",
      "dazzling cleanliness, a smiling welcome, a cheerful place near the door,\n",
      "and hot, fresh tea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "177. DRESS MENDING.--Here is a good field. There is a vast army of women\n",
      "who would patronize a mending office rather than run around the city to\n",
      "find a sewing woman, or use their own limited time in the use of the\n",
      "needle. Have a tariff of prices for mending gloves, sewing on buttons,\n",
      "renewing the sleeves, putting braid around the bottom of dresses, etc.\n",
      "The right woman could earn a good living at this business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "178. LACE HANDLING.--The mending and washing of fine laces is a work\n",
      "that is given to experts, and commands high prices, yet is easily\n",
      "learned. In five lessons at a dollar apiece any lady of ordinary\n",
      "intelligence can learn, or, cheaper yet, one can sometimes give services\n",
      "in return for instruction. You are then in a position to earn a great\n",
      "deal of money. Issue a thousand circulars to the wealthier people of the\n",
      "city, letting them know of your enterprise. This plan combines the three\n",
      "advantages of fascinating employment, good pay, and work done at home.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "179. INTELLIGENCE OFFICE on the subscription plan.--Buy a copy of the\n",
      "“Social Register;” send circulars to all persons named therein; announce\n",
      "that you have opened an intelligence office on a new plan. For $10 a\n",
      "year you will keep them supplied with as many servants as they want, and\n",
      "you will guarantee satisfaction. Make a specialty of securing servants\n",
      "for people going out of town. Thus you will go far toward solving the\n",
      "perplexing question for your patrons, and make an excellent living for\n",
      "yourself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "180. PROFESSIONAL MENDING.--Hotels, boarding houses and bachelor\n",
      "apartments have loud and long calls for mending. Mothers with little\n",
      "ones, professional women, and school-teachers, as well as men, have\n",
      "neither time nor taste for this kind of work. Have an outfit in a small\n",
      "satchel, which should contain a light lunch, a white apron, and various\n",
      "assortments of tapes, buttons, etc. In a short time one would have a\n",
      "regular round of customers. One lady who did this never had to go out of\n",
      "one large hotel for work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "181. THE COLLEGE CRAM.--There is room for a lady with a knowledge of the\n",
      "classics and a faculty for teaching to take boys and young men and carry\n",
      "them over the hard spots in their education. These hard spots, which are\n",
      "known as examinations, conditions, etc., are the bane and bugbear of\n",
      "many a young man’s education. In one town a lady earns $100 per month by\n",
      "taking pupils through the intricacies of algebra and Latin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "182. SHOE AND WRAP ROOM.--A room in some fashionable quarter where\n",
      "ladies could go after a journey on the cars and have the dust brushed\n",
      "off their wraps and their shoes polished would doubtless prove\n",
      "remunerative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "183. GENERAL CONVENIENCE ROOM.--The last idea might be combined with\n",
      "this. Have a room in which, for the charge of a dime, one could get a\n",
      "glass of ice-water, could read the morning paper, have his clothes\n",
      "brushed, and look over a map of the city or a directory, and have all\n",
      "the advantages of a toilet room.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "184. SICK-ROOM DELICACIES.--Another unoccupied field is the preparation\n",
      "of delicacies for the sick. Bouillon, chocolate, jellies and many other\n",
      "kinds of delicacies could be prepared and placed in a show window in\n",
      "some fashionable part of the town. The conditions of success are\n",
      "exquisite neatness and daintiness. It would pay well, for people stop at\n",
      "no cost in providing for their sick friends.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "185. SHOPPING COMMISSION.--If you live at a little distance from the\n",
      "city, a good business may be built up by shopping for your friends and\n",
      "neighbors. By dint of experience you know where to buy, and when your\n",
      "practice is built up you can buy cheaper by reason of larger purchases,\n",
      "and you can give both of these advantages to your patrons. Many women\n",
      "might find here both a congenial and profitable field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "186. SCHOOL LUNCHEON.--Here is another good field. Tens of thousands of\n",
      "schoolchildren have to eat a cold luncheon. Rent a small room near a\n",
      "schoolhouse, and provide bouillon, clam and chicken soups, sandwiches,\n",
      "baked beans, lamb pies, with white and brown bread, plain cake and\n",
      "fruit. You will help to preserve the digestion of myriads of children,\n",
      "as well as fill your own pocket with cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "187. HATCHING BIRDS.--Buy half a dozen songsters at $1.50 apiece, the\n",
      "females at half that price. Get proper cages, mate the birds, provide\n",
      "soft nests made chiefly of cotton; and with care you can do an excellent\n",
      "business. Birds in good condition mate two or three times a year. One\n",
      "lady, with eighteen pairs of canary birds netted $500 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "188. BUTTER AND EGG STORE.--Butter and eggs are two things which every\n",
      "housekeeper wants fresh, but which are difficult to obtain. Get some\n",
      "reliable farmer to supply you at stated dates, and procure a list of\n",
      "customers. Then with a boy to deliver and a push cart for the\n",
      "merchandise, you have little to do but figure your profits. An advantage\n",
      "of this plan is that it gives you the most of your time for other work.\n",
      "The business may be extended almost _ad infinitum_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "189. SARATOGA CHIPS.--These are a sample of what may be done with a\n",
      "single good article by one who knows how. One family has a weekly income\n",
      "of $12.50 from this means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "190. FANCY LAMP SHADES.--Made of crêpe papers they are very cheap, and\n",
      "look almost as well as silk. Any woman of ordinary ability can make\n",
      "them, and they sell readily. She can buy for sixty cents material for a\n",
      "shade which she can sell for $1.25, thus more than doubling her money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "191. BEE-KEEPING.--This is another means of large profit. It can be\n",
      "carried on even in a city where there is a small plot of ground. Fill\n",
      "all the space not occupied by the hives with white clover and such other\n",
      "flowers as your study of bees will tell you they delight in. Buy a book\n",
      "about bees. The advantage of this industry is that the cost of\n",
      "supporting the bees is practically nothing. There is no risk. After the\n",
      "first small expenditure of capital for boxes and hives all is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "192. CLEANSING AND BLEACHING.--There are many things too costly to be\n",
      "intrusted to an ordinary washerwoman, and many other cleansing processes\n",
      "that do not come within that woman’s sphere. Cleaning feathers, velvets,\n",
      "furs, gloves, silks, and many other articles afford a wide opportunity\n",
      "for one who understands the business. Who can take grease spots from\n",
      "carpets, fruit stains from napkins and table covers, paint from windows,\n",
      "thumb-marks from books, and scratches from furniture? Here is a useful\n",
      "field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "193. FANCY SOAPS.--Fortunes have been made from fancy soaps. The process\n",
      "of making is easy, and the variety of method is so great, and the\n",
      "possible ingredients so many, that there need be no danger of infringing\n",
      "on anyone’s trademark. Get a recipe-book and practice on the kinds given\n",
      "in the formulas; then branch out into new kinds. The sale will depend\n",
      "upon your ability. Give your product an attractive appearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "194. HOME ARCHITECTURE.--Write to the secretaries or agents of church\n",
      "building societies. Many of these societies publish pamphlets, in which,\n",
      "in addition to the designs for churches, will be found many cuts for\n",
      "pretty little parsonages. From these you can compile an attractive\n",
      "little book of home architecture, which would sell to every person\n",
      "contemplating building a home; and almost every one living in a rented\n",
      "house hopes some day to rear his own domicile. If you have a friend who\n",
      "is an architect, he would procure for you other books of plans.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "195. HOME ORNAMENTS.--What is a home without at least a few trifling\n",
      "ornaments? An inventive mind can think of a hundred inexpensive ways of\n",
      "beautifying a room. But most people are not inventive. If, therefore,\n",
      "you have that gift, and can think of a few novelties in lace and\n",
      "embroidered goods which you can make and sell for fractions of a dollar,\n",
      "you will have opened your way to constant and remunerative employment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "196. DOUBTFUL DEBTS.--It is well known that in efforts that require\n",
      "perseverance and persistence women succeed better than men. Grocers,\n",
      "butchers, real estate agents, and in fact almost every business man, has\n",
      "a large number of accounts, a considerable per cent. of which he\n",
      "considers worthless. To any one who could succeed in collecting them,\n",
      "the dealer would give a very large per cent., in some cases even\n",
      "amounting to half the bill. Many of these are really collectible if\n",
      "attempted with the persuasive arts of womanhood. Here is a large and\n",
      "profitable field for a woman having the right qualifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "197. DRESSING DOLLS.--A fair profit can be made by taking orders for\n",
      "making dolls’ dresses, as they can be bought and dressed for about\n",
      "one-half the cost of those already dressed. Persons giving the order\n",
      "should be required to bring the materials for the dress.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "198. FRUIT PRESERVERS.--Vast numbers of people are in the country during\n",
      "the fruit season, and cannot “do up” fruits; they must depend on the\n",
      "grocer. Let a thrifty, economical woman who _knows how_ equip herself\n",
      "with sugar, fruit, cans and preserve kettles, and she will not long wait\n",
      "for customers if she makes her business known. The second year, her\n",
      "patrons having tested her talents and tasted her fruits, and finding\n",
      "them so much better than “store goods,” will flood her with orders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "199. A MUSHROOM CELLAR.--An enterprising woman hired a cellar at a rent\n",
      "of $10 per month, had it fitted up with shelves, placed on these shelves\n",
      "in order, straw, fertilizers, and soil; then put on mushroom spawn,\n",
      "renewing it at intervals, as also at longer intervals the soil. Average\n",
      "sale of mushrooms per week, $31.50. Average expenses, $8.80. Profit per\n",
      "week, $22.70.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "200. POULTRY RAISING.--Following is the experience of another woman in\n",
      "raising poultry. She bought forty-five Minorcas, because they lay a\n",
      "large white egg, and are nonsitters and prolific layers. Each hen laid\n",
      "on an average one hundred and sixty-four eggs per annum. She purchased\n",
      "also forty Brahmas for sitters and for fattening. Total expenses for\n",
      "fowls and for keeping, $278.70. Total receipts, $1,144.11. Net profit,\n",
      "$865.31.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "201. HOME HOTHOUSE.--Thousands of people will buy plants already started\n",
      "who would not go to the trouble to buy seeds, slips, and pots. There is\n",
      "also a large demand for cut flowers all the year round. Have a cellar\n",
      "for rooting, and a south room for sunning. A liberal use of cards and\n",
      "circulars, stating what you propose to do, will surely bring custom. The\n",
      "secret of the florists’ business is to provide flowers for every month\n",
      "in the year, and to force or retard the flowers that suit the demands of\n",
      "each month. This is a very pretty employment for a woman, and can be\n",
      "done in her own home. There are three hundred and twelve floral\n",
      "establishments in this country managed by women. The work is easy and\n",
      "tasteful to ladies. The elements of success are the habit of early\n",
      "rising, business ability, close superintendence of laborers, intelligent\n",
      "advertising, knowledge of plants, and promptness in filling orders. The\n",
      "best location is near a large cemetery. One florist thus located takes\n",
      "in from $1,500 to $2,000 per month during the busy season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "202. ART NEEDLEWORK.--Here is the way a woman paid off a $600 mortgage\n",
      "on her home, and at the same time attended to her domestic duties. She\n",
      "bought linens stamped with designs, and gave her spare time to\n",
      "decorative embroidery. She disposed of her work at the Woman’s Exchange,\n",
      "and at the art stores. Six hundred dollars in spare minutes are not a\n",
      "bad showing. Besides, one could form a class and add the income from\n",
      "teaching. Mrs. Clara Louise Kellogg began by giving lessons in\n",
      "embroidery at the age of fourteen. Before her fifteenth birthday she was\n",
      "earning $30 a week with these classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "203. NEWS AGENCY.--Keep the daily papers. Almost any lady who will go\n",
      "into the business could count on one hundred patrons; and these by the\n",
      "recommendation of friends could easily be increased to five hundred. One\n",
      "hundred patrons would mean at least $3 per week, and five hundred\n",
      "patrons would mean at least $15 per week. Tact, enterprise, and good\n",
      "service are the qualities needed. If your place is on the main street,\n",
      "and you can make a show-window for periodicals, your income will be much\n",
      "augmented. A woman came to this country and heard of a news stand for\n",
      "sale for $250. She sold her jewels to purchase it. With her two\n",
      "brothers she made it a success, and it now supports three families.\n",
      "“Courtesy and application,” she says, “were my capital.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "204. WOMEN’S WANTS.--Take advantage of bargain sales--ribbons, silks,\n",
      "lace, and velvets. They can be had, if you watch the papers, at very\n",
      "trifling cost, but wondrous are the shapes into which they can be made\n",
      "by woman’s deft fingers. You can make boas, ruchings, berthas, lace\n",
      "bibs, draped collars, belts, etc. Every woman wants these things, and\n",
      "will buy them if they can be found in colors and style required. They\n",
      "can be sold at moderate cost, and at a very large profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "205. HOME PRINTING PRESS.--Pay $10 for a press, and a like sum for type\n",
      "and other accessories. Print visiting cards, at-home cards, business,\n",
      "reception, and wedding cards, tickets of admission, etc. Give a specimen\n",
      "of your work to every one of your friends, and request their patronage;\n",
      "place circulars with samples and rates in the stores, and solicit the\n",
      "favors of business men. Doing the work in your own home, you have no\n",
      "extra rent to pay as have printing establishments, and you can do the\n",
      "work much cheaper and still make a profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "206. SHORT SERVICE BUREAU.--Many people want help in an emergency, and\n",
      "for a short time only. The housewife is suddenly taken ill, a servant\n",
      "without warning leaves, company unexpectedly comes, stoves are to be put\n",
      "up, yards are to be cleaned, gardens dug, snow shoveled, clothes washed,\n",
      "and a hundred other things done requiring short service only. Keep a\n",
      "list of men and women who go out at labor. Know accurately their\n",
      "whereabouts every day. Be ready instantly to supply any one’s demand.\n",
      "When it is known that you furnish that kind of service, your office will\n",
      "be in demand, and your patrons well willing to pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "207. DELICATESSEN ROOM.--Here is a paying business that is not\n",
      "overcrowded, but success depends upon the quality of the goods. Make\n",
      "yourself a specialist in cookery. Homemade pies, plum puddings, orange\n",
      "marmalade, salted almonds, fancy cakes, jellies and jams can be made and\n",
      "sold at a good profit. Bakers and grocers will be forced to keep them\n",
      "when once there is a demand for your goods. This is no speculative idea.\n",
      "Many a woman has not only made a living, but accumulated a snug little\n",
      "fortune by this means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "208. MISCELLANEOUS EXCHANGE.--Many people have no use for some of their\n",
      "possessions, but desire something else; others would be glad to get what\n",
      "these possess. Establish a place for the exchange of typewriters, sewing\n",
      "machines, bicycles, baby carriages, jewelry, bric-à-brac, etc. Charge\n",
      "both parties to the exchange a small commission. This plan has the\n",
      "advantage that it requires no capital, and hence has no risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "209. CAP AND APRON PLAN.--Here is a plan available near any large hotel.\n",
      "Have a place for the sale of aprons, waiters’ jackets, cooks’ caps, etc.\n",
      "Get out a great quantity of circulars, stating your plan in an\n",
      "attractive form, and have a boy to distribute them--one upon whom you\n",
      "can rely to hand one to every employee of hotel shop and store. Repeat\n",
      "the circulars every week until your business is thoroughly known.\n",
      "Arrange to keep the articles in repair, and engage the agency of some\n",
      "laundry establishment for their washing; then with the work of selling,\n",
      "repairing and laundrying these goods you will have an established\n",
      "business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "210. KITCHEN UTENSILS.--As a rule you can sell five kitchen utensils\n",
      "where you can sell one book. The former shows for itself; the latter\n",
      "must be exhibited and explained. Send to a large wholesaler for the most\n",
      "modern samples of labor-saving tools for the kitchen. Test them for a\n",
      "few days yourself. Then start out among your neighbors. A housewife will\n",
      "purchase anything that lightens labor if it is only cheap. An\n",
      "enthusiastic person can make many dollars a day selling useful articles\n",
      "for the kitchen. A woman for three months averaged $4 a day selling an\n",
      "improved coffee pot.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "211. WEDDING MANAGER.--How many brides shrink from the work of a large\n",
      "wedding, while at the same time feeling under obligations to have one! A\n",
      "lady who has an artistic taste and a knowledge of the best social\n",
      "customs may very properly undertake the management of a wedding. She\n",
      "should know what is proper for the bride’s outfit, and how to dress her,\n",
      "how to decorate the rooms, what style of invitations to issue, and in\n",
      "short, all the delightfully perplexing details of a wedding. For this\n",
      "work she has a right to charge a fair sum, and if the wedding proves to\n",
      "be a very pretty one, she is entitled to the credit of it. When once the\n",
      "office of a lady manager is recognized, and the relief afforded to the\n",
      "bride’s family appreciated, the fashion will quickly spread, and others\n",
      "will wish to avail themselves of your taste and skill.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "212. FOREIGN HOMES.--Here is an example of the pluck and enterprise of\n",
      "an American girl: Miss Mary Widdicomb went to Paris in company with a\n",
      "lady friend, and established a home for Americans in that capital. Her\n",
      "rooms accommodated thirty-five, and such was the success of her venture\n",
      "that she is about to open another apartment. Think of it! You can go to\n",
      "a French city and hear the American language, associate with American\n",
      "people, and have American surroundings the same as if in the United\n",
      "States. Here is an opportunity for young women with small capital to see\n",
      "a foreign country and make money at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "213. LADY BARBER.--There is a school in New York for the instruction of\n",
      "barbers. Three months’ apprenticeship will give you a knowledge of the\n",
      "trade. One lady who graduated a year ago from the school now has two\n",
      "assistants, and is earning from $6 to $10 a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "214. MINERAL COLLECTIONS FOR SCHOOLS.--Dana’s Mineralogy gives fourteen\n",
      "hundred places in the United States where rare minerals are found. There\n",
      "are 240,968 public schools, and each one needs a mineral collection. Why\n",
      "has no one thought of gathering these rare stones and selling them to\n",
      "our public schools? At $1 a school, the sale should be $240,698, but\n",
      "many rare collections would bring $5, and even $10 each.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "215. TURKISH BATH.--One lady opened a place for Turkish and Russian\n",
      "baths. She went around among her lady friends and acquaintances and\n",
      "secured the promise of a paying patronage. Five promised their patronage\n",
      "every week, eight every two weeks, and twenty-four at least once a\n",
      "month. Thus the sum of $60 per month was assured at the start, and this\n",
      "paid for rent and assistants, with a good margin of profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "216. TRAINED NURSES.--Trained nurses in our large cities command $25 a\n",
      "week. The duties are exacting, but not difficult. Assistant nurses\n",
      "receive $15. The latter have less responsibilities, and are not required\n",
      "to spend so long a time in training. This is an inviting field for\n",
      "ladies who have gifts and tastes for this work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "217. TRAVELING COMPANION.--If you have a good education and can make\n",
      "yourself agreeable, your services ought not to go long begging for an\n",
      "engagement in this delightful occupation. Watch the advertisements in\n",
      "the daily papers; better yet, insert an advertisement of your own,\n",
      "modestly stating your qualifications. The remuneration depends upon the\n",
      "wealth and liberality of your employer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "218. PAPER FLOWERS.--This has become a distinct trade. You can learn in\n",
      "a few months. There is a paper flower store in Broadway, New York, which\n",
      "does an immense business. There are great possibilities in this line in\n",
      "every city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "219. FRENCH PERFUMER AND COMPLEXION EXPERT.--How does this\n",
      "sound?--Madame Racier, French Perfumer. Equip yourself with perfumes,\n",
      "essences, tinctures, extracts, spirit waters, cosmetics, infusions,\n",
      "pastiles, tooth powders, washes, cachous, hair dyes, sachets, essential\n",
      "oils, etc. All ladies like perfumes. Once let it be known that you are\n",
      "an authority on the subject, and you will lack neither patronage nor\n",
      "profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "220. A WOMAN’S HOTEL.--A hotel exclusively for women would no doubt be a\n",
      "paying investment. More than fifty thousand ladies without male escorts\n",
      "stop every year in the hotels of New York City. A very large proportion\n",
      "of this number would patronize a cheap, clean, well-kept place, fitted\n",
      "up and conducted solely for the comfort of ladies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "221. GUIDE FOR SHOPPERS.--A department store in New York recently made a\n",
      "census of its customers, and from the count kept for a single week it\n",
      "was estimated that 3,125,000 persons passed through its doors every\n",
      "year. This for a single store. But there are thousands of stores. Vast\n",
      "numbers of these people are from the country, and do not know where they\n",
      "can trade to the best advantage. What a field is here for a shoppers’\n",
      "guide! Ascertain what stores make a specialty of certain goods, what\n",
      "ones sell the cheapest in certain lines, and what days they make\n",
      "bargains in certain wares. Show by what routes the places are best\n",
      "reached, where to dine, etc. Fill a little book with just the\n",
      "information a shopper wants to know; call it “The Ladies’ Shopping\n",
      "Guide,” put it on the market at ten cents, and you can sell millions of\n",
      "them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "222. BICYCLE INSTRUCTION.--Why, may not a woman teach “the wheel” as\n",
      "well as a man? Many women are restrained from learning through the\n",
      "dislike of falling from the wheel into the arms of a strange man,\n",
      "commonly a negro. A woman’s bicycle academy would pay in any large city.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "223. COOKING SCHOOL.--Madam Parloa and Madam Rorer have set the example,\n",
      "and they will be sure to have many imitators. A course of instruction in\n",
      "cooking, costing $10, is a vastly better investment to any young woman\n",
      "than a course on a piano costing $100, or many times that sum. First,\n",
      "learn the art thoroughly yourself and then teach it to others. There is\n",
      "money in this, but it needs taste, tact and work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "224. THE BOARDING HOUSE.--One who has a taste for cooking and a little\n",
      "marketing skill can do well in this somewhat overworked and not always\n",
      "paying business. The gains increase from zero with one boarder, in\n",
      "geometrical progression, until $1 a head is realized with twenty\n",
      "boarders. Profits, $20 a week. With great skill and management this may\n",
      "be doubled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "225. PEN ENGRAVING.--If you have a circle of one hundred friends, and\n",
      "can secure their patronage, you can make a fair living for one person at\n",
      "engraving cards. A lady with a large calling list should engrave $500\n",
      "worth of cards a year. Expenses, $25. Remuneration for work, $475.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "226. A LADIES’ RESTAURANT.--A restaurant where delicacies pleasing to\n",
      "ladies are made a specialty would surely pay. A lady who recently\n",
      "established one adjoining a large department store has been obliged to\n",
      "enlarge her premises to accommodate her crowd of patrons.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "227. A WOMAN’S NEWSPAPER.--One has just been started in a Western city.\n",
      "The editors, reporters, printers, and press-feeders, are all women. Of\n",
      "course it advocates woman’s reform. An enterprise of this kind requires\n",
      "considerable capital, and is not without risk, but a woman of ability\n",
      "and experience can make it pay as well as a man, besides the advantage\n",
      "of an appeal directly to her sex in support of a paper conducted in this\n",
      "manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "228. ADVERTISING AGENT.--A lady by her courtesy, tact, and gentle\n",
      "address, is especially fitted for this work. All our great newspapers\n",
      "and magazines pay large salaries to successful agents, for, as a rule,\n",
      "the advertising department is the one that pays the dividends of the\n",
      "business. The shopkeepers and others who, by reason of repeated\n",
      "solicitations give the cold shoulder to the male agent, would listen at\n",
      "least respectfully to a lady. On the whole, this field presents to\n",
      "ladies who have the right qualities better opportunities than to men.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "229. THE CIVIL SERVICE.--This is now open to women. There are more then\n",
      "ten thousand of these places to be filled every year. Clerkships range\n",
      "from $600 to $3,000. Very few fall below $1,000. These places, according\n",
      "to the Civil Service Law, are filled by competitive examinations. There\n",
      "are thousands of bright young women who secured these places, not\n",
      "through any governmental pull, but by sheer merit in examinations. Get a\n",
      "book entitled “Civil Service,” by John M. Comstock, Chairman of the\n",
      "United States Board of Examiners, for the Customs Service in New York\n",
      "City, and published by Henry Holt & Co. This book will give you a\n",
      "complete table of the positions open, the salaries attached to each, and\n",
      "a list of questions required to be answered.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "230. POST-PRANDIAL CLASSES.--Few, even among educated women, are masters\n",
      "of themselves to the extent of being able to rise before an audience,\n",
      "and without previous preparation express themselves clearly and\n",
      "creditably on whatever subject may be under discussion. A woman in New\n",
      "York, a member of Sorosis, made a reputation for bright, witty,\n",
      "after-dinner speeches. As she earned her living by newspaper work, a\n",
      "friend said to her, “Why don’t you add to your income by teaching other\n",
      "women how to say a few graceful words in public?” She caught at the\n",
      "idea, and organized classes in the hitherto untaught art of\n",
      "post-prandial speech-making, and had capital success, earning $500 by it\n",
      "in one season.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "231. WOMEN DRUGGISTS.--The neatness of women, their delicacy and\n",
      "attention to details, qualify them admirably for the drug business. At\n",
      "the Woman’s Infirmary, New York, the apothecary department is entirely\n",
      "in the hands of ladies. Drug clerks receive on the average of $9 per\n",
      "week. There are few lady proprietors, but there is no reason why there\n",
      "should not be more, as the business is very profitable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "232. ALMANAC MAKERS.--Of late years many of the great dailies issue\n",
      "yearly almanacs. The mass of matter which goes to make up these\n",
      "publications can be collected as well by women, who have gifts for\n",
      "details, as by those of the other sex. In one publication house a woman\n",
      "is paid $30 a week to manage one of these almanacs, and in another $20\n",
      "for the compiling of an index for the daily paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "233. WOMEN LECTURERS.--Women of talent have earned a competence and\n",
      "almost a fortune on the platform. Lucy Stone was sometimes paid as high\n",
      "as $260 for a lecture, and Anna Dickinson also received large sums. The\n",
      "lady who hopes to succeed in this field must have fluency, the gift of\n",
      "oratory, self-poise, and a certain dramatic or magnetic power.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "234. MAGAZINE CONTRIBUTORS.--In this work women are paid as much as men,\n",
      "and their facile pens are often able to turn out equal and even\n",
      "superior work. The Harpers pay $10 a page; the Atlantic Monthly, $6 to\n",
      "$10; the North American Review, $1.50.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "235. WOMEN PHYSICIANS.--Says a recent publication: “There is a real\n",
      "necessity for women physicians; there are many ladies who prefer them,\n",
      "and in some cases will consult no other. There are now over one thousand\n",
      "lady physicians in the United States, but the number will soon be\n",
      "doubled, and even trebled. Several of these lady physicians are making\n",
      "over $2,000 a year.” One of them says: “I have several well-to-do\n",
      "families whom I charge by the year. I charge $200, if they are people\n",
      "who are considered well off; less, if they are poor.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "236. PAPER BOX MAKING.--Hundreds of women are making paper boxes, but as\n",
      "employees, not as proprietors. A woman made the first orange box in\n",
      "California. Seeing that it was a good thing, and that there would soon\n",
      "be a demand for others, she built a factory, and is now turning out\n",
      "fifty thousand boxes a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "237. HORTICULTURE.--Here is an example of what a California woman can\n",
      "do. A widow having four boys purchased thirty-six acres of land in San\n",
      "Jose, and under her personal care, aided by her boys, planted the tract\n",
      "with apricot, cherry and prune trees. For four years she did all the\n",
      "pruning, a difficult task for a refined and delicate woman, accustomed\n",
      "as she had been to luxuriant ease. Her prune trees alone netted $2,700\n",
      "in one year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "238. VOCALISTS.--A lady with a good voice is certain of making a\n",
      "living, some have made fortunes with it. The demand is wide and various.\n",
      "If your taste does not incline to the stage, there is still a large\n",
      "field in the church. All large churches, and many small ones now, have\n",
      "paid choirs. The leading vocalists are commonly well paid. There are a\n",
      "great number of altos and sopranos in New York and Brooklyn, and in the\n",
      "fashionable suburbs, who receive $1,000 a year, or an excess of that\n",
      "sum. And this is an excellent compensation when it is remembered that\n",
      "the singer has nearly all her time in which to pursue some other\n",
      "vocation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "239. PACKING TRUNKS.--This is a Paris occupation carried on exclusively\n",
      "by women. You leave your order at the office of the transportation\n",
      "company, and say when you want a professional packer. She comes, and is\n",
      "paid fifty cents, and sometimes $1 an hour for her services. She has\n",
      "genius for folding dresses so that they can be carried all over the\n",
      "world without a wrinkle. She wraps bonnets in tissue paper. She tucks\n",
      "away bric-à-brac in a way that makes breakage impossible. This industry\n",
      "might be introduced profitably into this country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "240. WOMEN COSTUMERS.--Costumes for the stage are now gotten up mostly\n",
      "by men. A woman of taste and ability could make a success of this\n",
      "business. Many rich ladies would consult them in matters of personal\n",
      "wardrobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "241. EXPRESS OFFICE.--A woman can sit in an office as well as a man. One\n",
      "woman in Boston tried it four years ago, beginning in a modest way. Now\n",
      "she has three offices and five teams in constant use.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "242. A FANCY BAKERY.--An elegant and educated young woman in San\n",
      "Francisco took a dingy, dying little bakeshop, with sickening sights and\n",
      "smells. She put it in order. In two months she had cleared $700, and in\n",
      "four months $1,800. Another woman in Brooklyn has just opened a bakery\n",
      "under very flattering prospects. She works on the plan of exquisite\n",
      "neatness, trimming her windows like those of a fancy goods’ dealer, and\n",
      "wrapping her bread in tissue paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "243. WOMEN GROCERS.--There are not many women in the grocer business,\n",
      "but there is no reason why there should not be. A woman grocer in a\n",
      "Western State who has been established since 1860, has a business worth\n",
      "$80,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "244. FOOD AND MEDICINE SAMPLES.--Proprietors of patent medicines and\n",
      "foods will give you a large commission to introduce their inventions\n",
      "into homes, and if successful, you will soon be employed at a good\n",
      "salary. These proprietors often pay ladies to introduce samples at\n",
      "country stores. The storekeeper will give you room rent free for a few\n",
      "days, with the understanding that he alone has the sale of the article\n",
      "in the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "245. SAMPLES IN STORES.--Ladies of tact and good address are receiving\n",
      "fair salaries in the introduction of new articles. Every inventor is\n",
      "anxious to introduce his goods, and every storekeeper is equally\n",
      "desirous to sell. Call upon the proprietor of some new article of\n",
      "household use, secure territory, and then solicit space in a country\n",
      "store. After three or four days in one store you should go to another,\n",
      "or perhaps to the next town. You may have to begin on a commission, but\n",
      "if successful you can soon command a salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "246. SAMPLES FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.--Others find ample remuneration in\n",
      "introducing new articles from house to house. We know a little lady in\n",
      "Brooklyn who is paid well for giving away samples of a new baby food.\n",
      "This is much more pleasant work than that of importuning people to\n",
      "purchase.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "247. THE WOMAN BEAUTIFIER.--Whatever is of the nature of beauty appeals\n",
      "to the heart of woman. A lady who has the secret of making other women\n",
      "beautiful cannot fail of success. After making a study of your business,\n",
      "advertise that you understand the art of removing moles, wrinkles,\n",
      "warts, wens, birthmarks, tan, freckles, and superfluous hair. If\n",
      "successful in pleasing one or two leaders of fashion, you will have\n",
      "plenty of custom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "248. THE MANICURE PARLOR.--The manicure business is yearly increasing.\n",
      "For $15 you can learn the business. Implements will cost you $10 more.\n",
      "With the capital of $25 you can begin business, and, if ladylike in\n",
      "appearance and gentle in touch, you can build up a big business in the\n",
      "right neighborhood. Any lady would prefer in this art to patronize one\n",
      "of her own sex. Get out cards and circulars and scatter them freely.\n",
      "There is room for many women to excel in this field. One lady who\n",
      "entered upon this work two years ago says she is on the road to a\n",
      "fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "249. THE MASSAGE TREATMENT.--Another lady is having great success with\n",
      "the massage treatment. She has now more than seventy regular patrons.\n",
      "This method of cure is easily learned and readily applied. Hardly a\n",
      "lady among your acquaintances is in good health. It is a proverb that no\n",
      "woman is well. A vast proportion of these cases are nervous and will\n",
      "yield to the massage treatment. If you have strong muscles you could\n",
      "readily achieve a large practice by this system, especially in summer\n",
      "resorts and places where invalids flock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "250. ICE CREAM PARLOR.--This is not new, but possesses possibilities of\n",
      "a good living where the field is not overworked. There are five things\n",
      "necessary to success, and in the following order of importance: An\n",
      "attractive place in a clean, fashionable locality; good and generous\n",
      "plates of cream; unexcelled neatness; polite service; and popular\n",
      "prices. We have known a lady commencing business on these principles to\n",
      "oust quickly an older establishment run on slacker methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "251. FLOWER PACKETS.--Buy quantities of flower seeds of all varieties.\n",
      "Put them up in very small envelopes, a few seeds in each one, advertise\n",
      "that you will send samples for a penny a kind, ten for six cents,\n",
      "twenty-five for fifteen cents, fifty for twenty-five cents, etc. A large\n",
      "mail envelope will hold fifty or more of the smaller ones containing\n",
      "seeds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "252. LADY CATERER.--A woman has a fine chance to succeed as a caterer.\n",
      "Her taste in arranging tables should at least make her hold her own with\n",
      "business rivals of the opposite sex. Mrs. A. B. Marshall, a woman\n",
      "caterer of London, often manages a supper for one hundred guests.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "253. DELICACIES FOR INVALIDS.--This is a new field which is being\n",
      "worked with much promise. “Mrs. Kate Teachman,” as she is known in the\n",
      "New York _Sun_, is working in this line with great success. She says:\n",
      "“Of course, if you want this sort of thing you must pay for\n",
      "it--sixty-five cents for a pint of broth, seventy-five cents for a pint\n",
      "of puree, sixty-five cents for a half-pint of jelly, twenty-five cents\n",
      "for chopped chicken sandwiches.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "254. INSECT POWDER.--A California woman who now owns four hundred acres\n",
      "of land has a history that ought to inspire other women with a belief in\n",
      "their ability to get on in the world. In 1861 her husband died, leaving\n",
      "her with a debt of $1,400, three children, and a small farm mortgaged.\n",
      "Within five years she had paid the mortgage by taking boarders, raising\n",
      "chickens, and doing whatever offered. In 1877 she began to raise\n",
      "pyrethrum, the plant from which insect powder is made, some years having\n",
      "one hundred acres planted with it. Now she has from fifty to eighty\n",
      "employees of both sexes, and is said to be worth half a million dollars.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "255. RICE CULTIVATOR.--A few years ago a young Iowa girl-squatter, with\n",
      "her sixteen-year-old brother, took up a government claim in Louisiana,\n",
      "and went to planting rice, the first crop of which paid her $1,000. She\n",
      "lives in a three-room cottage, and has a few fruit trees, plenty of good\n",
      "fences, and a sea of waving rice-blades. Her nearest neighbor is another\n",
      "girl-farmer who also settled a government claim, and is bossing an\n",
      "orchard that is giving her a comfortable living.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "256. YEAST CAKES.--Here is what one woman did: Being thrown on her own\n",
      "resources, instead of following the beaten path of custom, she engaged\n",
      "in something novel. She made yeast cakes. Gradually her trade increased\n",
      "until she was obliged to hire help, and in time had to build an addition\n",
      "to the house to provide room for her thriving business. She now makes a\n",
      "good living, finding her work congenial as well as profitable. Here is\n",
      "her recipe: Take one dozen hops and boil two or three hours, remove from\n",
      "the fire and strain through a sieve, adding boiling water until there\n",
      "are three or four quarts of the liquid. Then thicken with canaille until\n",
      "quite stiff; and one-half tablespoonful of ginger and one-quarter cup of\n",
      "molasses; let it stand until cool, add one-half cup of salt yeast, or\n",
      "one cake of lard, and in the morning stir down with a little fine\n",
      "cornmeal. Let it rise again, then mix with cornmeal, roll, and cut with\n",
      "a cutter. This rule makes one hundred cakes. They sell for seventy-five\n",
      "cents per hundred, and retail for one cent apiece.\n",

      "257. PHYSICAL CULTURE.--There are twelve million young women in the\n",
      "United States. The great majority of them have an ailment of some kind;\n",
      "in fact, it is almost impossible to find a perfectly healthy woman.\n",
      "Physical culture will add years to one’s life. An eminent physician has\n",
      "estimated that twenty-four million years, or an average of two years\n",
      "each, can be added to the lives of our young women by simple bodily\n",
      "exercise of one hour each day. Get a book, study a chart, employ a\n",
      "teacher; then, after a thorough course go about among your friends and\n",
      "form a class. Induce your pupils to bring other pupils. Advertise,\n",
      "lecture, give class exhibitions. Charge $5 a quarter for a class of\n",
      "twelve; $4 for one of fifteen; $3 for one of twenty. Mr. John D. Hoover,\n",
      "of Los Angeles, Cal., says: “When I entered a college of oratory, I was\n",
      "almost penniless. I took a special course in physical culture, with a\n",
      "view to teaching that art. It is now eighteen months since I left the\n",
      "college, and during that time I have earned in clear cash from teaching\n",
      "physical culture the sum of $20,960. I have 1,507 pupils. My sister also\n",
      "has been very successful in teaching since she graduated, and has made\n",
      "quite a large sum of money.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "258. HOUSE CLEANING.--Enterprising men have taken up the work of house\n",
      "cleaning with considerable success, but the business can be managed\n",
      "better by a woman than by a man. If your patrons are not too many, you\n",
      "can personally superintend the work in each house yourself to the great\n",
      "satisfaction of the lady, who would commonly prefer to have it managed\n",
      "by one of her own sex. If your business increases so as to require your\n",
      "presence in the office, you can send a lady assistant to superintend the\n",
      "work. Have a fixed price per room where there is no extra work, such as\n",
      "painting, kalsomining, and paper hanging. In the latter case it is\n",
      "better to take the work by the job.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "259. SELLING OYSTERS.--Here is the way a woman with five little children\n",
      "gets a living: She hires a boy to open the oysters, which she then puts\n",
      "up in little pint pails and takes from house to house. She has many\n",
      "customers whom she serves regularly on certain days. Sales per week,\n",
      "fifty pints, or twenty-five quarts. Boy’s wages, $1. Net, $3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "260. PIE CART.--Hear what another woman says: “I have a little pie cart.\n",
      "It is nothing but a pie-crate mounted on wheels. I bake every morning\n",
      "ten pies and in the afternoon I sell them hot from door to door. I make\n",
      "about seven cents on a large pie, and four cents on small one.” Average\n",
      "earnings per day, fifty cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "261. MEN’S NECK TIES.--As every man, at least every well-dressed man,\n",
      "wears a tie, which must be renewed several times a year--white lawns\n",
      "every day--the number in demand is enormous. First learn the business,\n",
      "and then if you can sell them a little under the manufacturers’ price\n",
      "you are sure to dispose of all you can make. One girl earned $12 a week\n",
      "in this way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "262. DANCING TEACHER.--The natural grace of women fits them better than\n",
      "men to be teachers of this art, especially to be instructors of young\n",
      "girls. Dancing teachers charge on the average $15 a quarter. There are\n",
      "several very successful lady teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "263. HABERDASHER.--The selling of small articles of the dress and toilet\n",
      "is profitable if the location is good and the competition not too\n",
      "severe. Where one cannot purchase the articles outright, she can sell on\n",
      "commission. Dealers in small wares of this kind often take in from $12\n",
      "to $20 a day, of which on the average, one-sixth is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "264. LADY ARCHITECT.--There is no reason why women should not succeed in\n",
      "this occupation, since it is one in which taste is a chief requisite.\n",
      "Several young lady graduates of college have entered it recently, and\n",
      "with flattering success. Architects charge about three per cent. on\n",
      "contracts.\n",

      "\n",
      "265. LOST AND FOUND AGENCY.--In every large city numbers of articles are\n",
      "lost by the owners and found by others every day. A single New York\n",
      "paper contains daily from ten to twenty advertisements of lost\n",
      "articles. Open a small office, advertise in the “Lost and Found” column\n",
      "of the paper that you will receive any articles that may be found, and\n",
      "charge the owner a small commission. The agency could be carried on in\n",

      "and rich men have forced their way to success at the bayonet points of\n",
      "their fingers, and with the iron pry of an unconquerable will. Boys,\n",
      "here are a few hints for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "_Section 1. How a Boy can Get a Place._\n",
      "\n",
      "SEVEN WAYS TO GET A POSITION.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "266. FREE SERVICE.--Make friends with a clerk. Offer to go with him on\n",
      "the delivery wagon. He will be only too glad of your assistance. The\n",
      "next step will be to help in odd jobs about the store. After a little\n",
      "familiarity with the business, you will find an opening. Your friendly\n",
      "clerk will have a sick day, or a leave of absence, or a vacation. The\n",
      "employer knows you have assisted the clerk, and will gladly give you his\n",
      "place for a day or a week, and from temporary employment it is but a\n",
      "step to a permanent place.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "267. SPECIAL DEPARTMENT.--Make yourself familiar with a particular\n",
      "department of the work of shop or store. Suppose you take a pound of\n",
      "tea. It will surprise you to find out how many things you can learn\n",
      "about so insignificant a thing as a pound of tea. Ascertain the\n",
      "different brands; what markets they come from; where they are raised;\n",
      "how they are manufactured; in what quantities they are shipped; what\n",
      "are the fluctuations in price; who are the largest dealers; in what\n",
      "section of the country the trade is chiefly carried on. A study of these\n",
      "things will suggest other branches. A year given to a study of this\n",
      "kind, and you will know more about tea than the most trusted employee,\n",
      "whose knowledge is commonly of a superficial kind. Then, if you have an\n",
      "opportunity, you can surprise the merchant with a knowledge of his\n",
      "business, and he will be sure to give you a place as soon as he has an\n",
      "opening. One merchant says: “I always have a place for a person who can\n",
      "tell me anything about my business I don’t know myself.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "268. SHOW SUPERIORITY OF GOODS.--A man occupied his spare moments in\n",
      "measuring the linear feet of advertisements contained in the different\n",
      "Sunday papers, and sent the result to the one which had printed the\n",
      "most. Go around among customers and find what brand of goods they like\n",
      "the best. Then report to the makers of these brands, and you may be sure\n",
      "they will take an interest in you if they see that you take an interest\n",
      "in them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "269. ADVERTISING.--Here is an advertisement for the right kind of boy:\n",
      "“A brisk-footed, up-to-date boy, not afraid to work, will take a place\n",
      "at low wages for the sake of learning the business.” Here you have four\n",
      "qualities in two lines--quickness, intelligence, industry, and low\n",
      "wages--the four things men are looking for, and such an advertisement\n",
      "will not wait long for a reply.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "270. INFLUENCE.--Great names are mighty. Introduce yourself to the\n",
      "greatest man in your town, and tell him your qualifications and\n",
      "ambitions. Do not be afraid of him. A truly great man is more willing\n",
      "to do a real kindness to a meritorious boy than you think. Robert\n",
      "Lennox, an old-time New York merchant, one Sunday at church saw a timid\n",
      "young person looking anxiously around as if for a seat. “Come with me,”\n",
      "said Mr. L., “and I will give you a seat.” The next day the young man\n",
      "took a letter of recommendation to the store of a merchant. “Can I get a\n",
      "small bill of goods to begin business with?” he inquired. “I will trust\n",
      "anybody that Robert Lennox invites into his pew,” was the reply. “I owe\n",
      "all my success in life,” said Jonathan Sturges, “to the invitation of\n",
      "Robert Lennox to sit in his pew.” With the great-and-good-man’s\n",
      "indorsement you will find places waiting for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "271. A TRIAL WEEK.--All many boys want is a chance. When you apply in\n",
      "vain for a place, tell the proprietor you are sure that he needs you,\n",
      "and that you will come a week for nothing (better a month if you can\n",
      "afford it). If you really have the merit you think you have, it will be\n",
      "strange if you cannot displace some indolent or indifferent employee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "272. COMMISSION.--Offer to sell the dealer’s goods on commission. You\n",
      "must leave a deposit to cover the worth of the goods. Take the articles\n",
      "to your friends and tell them you are trying to get a place. In most\n",
      "cases, if the goods are cheap, they will try to help you, and you will\n",
      "be able to make an excellent report to your employer. When he sees that\n",
      "your service means money in his pocket, he will be eager to employ you\n",
      "at a salary.\n",

      "TWENTY HINTS FOR BOYS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "273. THE BOY MAGICIAN.--For fifty cents you can buy a book entitled\n",
      "“The Parlor Magician,” containing one hundred tricks for the drawing\n",
      "room. A few weeks’ practice should make you master of these arts, and\n",
      "then with your outfit you are ready for a money-making tour. It is best\n",
      "to take along a friend, as in some of the most clever tricks you will\n",
      "need an assistant.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "274. THE GLASS-BLOWER.--For twenty-five cents you can get a book with\n",
      "full instructions in the curious art of glass-blowing. The wondrous\n",
      "forms you will be able to produce, the pleasure of the work, and above\n",
      "all the money derived from the sale of your products, will delight the\n",
      "heart of any boy. There is money in glass-blowing after you have\n",
      "mastered the art, but if you would make a business of it you must\n",
      "apprentice yourself for a time to a master of the trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "275. THE DIME LUNCH.--There are thousands of business men and clerks in\n",
      "our large stores and offices who would prefer to pay ten or fifteen\n",
      "cents rather than go out to a restaurant. Especially is this the case in\n",
      "rainy weather. Pretty boxes with tasteful lunches could be prepared at a\n",
      "small cost, and taken through the places of business. The important item\n",
      "is attractiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "276. CANCELLED STAMPS.--In every large city there are dealers who will\n",
      "pay you for canceled stamps. Ordinary stamps bring about ten cents per\n",
      "thousand, but rare ones bring very high prices. Ask all your friends for\n",
      "their canceled stamps. In a store in New York there are several barrels\n",
      "full of postage stamps collected by boys. Each barrel contains a\n",
      "million.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "277. THE BOYS’ PRESS.--Do you know you can get a printing press with\n",
      "complete outfit, a full font of type, and one hundred cards for $3? You\n",
      "can make money easily by printing cards and doing other small press\n",
      "jobs. Charge fifty cents, seventy-five cents or $1 for cards, according\n",
      "to the quality of paper and amount of printing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "278. SAW AND SCROLL.--Most interesting articles, both of use and\n",
      "ornament, can be made by the scroll-saw. Some have earned boys’ fortunes\n",
      "in making these curious articles, and there is as much pleasure in\n",
      "making them as in getting the money for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "279. THE MAGIC LANTERN.--The very best lantern and slides can be\n",
      "obtained for $6. From that figure the price runs downward to fifty\n",
      "cents. Purchase a good one and give parlor exhibitions at a charge of\n",
      "five cents admission. As you become more expert, you can increase your\n",
      "price. If you are a success at the business, your services will be in\n",
      "demand for more pretentious entertainments, where you can make $5 or\n",
      "more in a single evening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "280. CANDY MAKING.--What can please a boy better than candy making.\n",
      "Offer your services free for a short time to a confectioner. When you\n",
      "have learned the trade, which you can do in a little while, commence the\n",
      "business on your own account in a small way. Beginning with those sweets\n",
      "which are easily made, you can extend your art as your business\n",
      "increases until you have a good trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "281. ODD JOBS.--“I push baby carriages through the park at five cents\n",
      "apiece,” says a Chicago boy. “I clean and oil bicycles,” says a New\n",
      "York lad. “I stand on the Boulevard and pump up tires,” declares a\n",
      "third. “I buy a dozen lemons and a pound of sugar and sell lemonade on\n",
      "all holidays and at times of parade,” says an enterprising schoolboy. “I\n",
      "carry bundles and valises from the train, and make often fifty cents a\n",
      "day,” says a Boston youth. “I hang up a slate on the front gate and take\n",
      "store orders for neighbors,” says a bright village lad.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "282. GENERAL EMPLOYMENT AGENCY.--Inform a hundred or more families in a\n",
      "particular district that at a certain hour of the day you will be there\n",
      "to carry messages, roll out barrels of ashes, go on errands, mail\n",
      "letters, black boots, and do whatever work they may require. If the work\n",
      "is sufficient to warrant it, a business partnership of boys may be\n",
      "formed, so that while one is engaged another can go on his usual rounds,\n",
      "and thus insure punctuality.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "283. COLLECT MAGAZINES.--Almost every one takes a literary magazine, and\n",
      "some take two or three. After a time they become refuse on their hands.\n",
      "Many persons would gladly give you a truck-load. But these are worth\n",
      "money, and second-hand dealers who sell them at five cents apiece will\n",
      "give you three cents for them.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "284. VACANT LOT.--If you live in the city, get the owner of a vacant lot\n",
      "to give you the privilege of raising vegetables. With a little\n",
      "experience you can easily raise from $50 to $100 worth of vegetables on\n",
      "a lot 20 × 100 feet. This will go far to eke out the support of a large\n",
      "family.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "285. BICYCLE TEACHING.--Here is a field for a stout lad of fifteen\n",
      "years. There are thousands of modest young ladies and men, especially\n",
      "elderly gentlemen, who would like to learn to ride a wheel, but do not\n",
      "like the publicity of a riding academy. Issue some neat cards and\n",
      "circulate them from house to house with the information that for the sum\n",
      "of $1 you will teach any one to ride. Most people have a back yard where\n",
      "such instruction could be given. Having no rent to pay, you could easily\n",
      "afford to take them for that price, as you have the advantage over the\n",
      "professional instructor, both of cheapness and privacy. There is a lot\n",
      "of money in this for the right kind of a boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "286. FIRST-COST SALES.--When public attention is aroused upon any\n",
      "subject, consider how you can turn it to account. Here is what a boy\n",
      "thirteen years old says: “When ‘Coin’s Financial School’ came out and\n",
      "the people were talking about it, I wrote to Mr. Harvey, the author, and\n",
      "got a lot of the books and sold them all before they got into the book\n",
      "stores here. I have made in this and like enterprises $500.” Like\n",
      "opportunities were presented in our late war, with the Dewey buttons,\n",
      "battleship pictures, etc. Keep your eyes open. Opportunities to make\n",
      "money are all about you. The alert boy makes the successful man.\n",
      "\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\n",
      "\n",
      "Boys, there is gold in all the mountains, pearls in all the seas, and\n",
      "money in every street. Elijah Morse at fifteen years of age bought a\n",
      "recipe for stove polish, paying $5 for the materials. He peddled it in a\n",
      "carpetbag, and from this small beginning grew the celebrated “Rising Sun\n",
      "Stove Polish,” whose huge factory covers four acres at West Canton,\n",
      "Mass., and whose proprietor is immensely rich. Cornelius Vanderbilt was\n",
      "a poor boy without a cent. When he died his estate was valued at\n",

      "but chiefly upon the kind of man. The right man selling the right book\n",
      "can make enormous wages. An agent selling a commentary on the Bible made\n",
      "sometimes $25 in half a day. An agent for the “People’s Encyclopædia”\n",
      "earned $3,000 in one year, and spent only about half the time in the\n",
      "work. Many agents for “Memoirs of General Grant” earned from $10 to $20\n",
      "a day. Ordinarily, an agent should be satisfied if he can make from $3\n",
      "to $5 a day. From this sum must come his expenses. Book agents receive\n",
      "from 25 to 45 per cent., according to the nature of the work. Forty per\n",
      "cent. is considered excellent compensation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "288. THE PATENT AGENCY.--Considerable business is now done in the\n",
      "selling of patent rights. The agent studies the lists that come out\n",
      "weekly in the “United States Patent Gazette,” and sends his circulars to\n",
      "those who have secured patents. The agent will charge from five to ten\n",
      "per cent., if he can arrange with a patentee for the sale of the\n",
      "patents. In other cases, he charges a fixed sum, which is paid in\n",
      "advance, and is considered an equivalent for his services whether or not\n",
      "he is successful in effecting a sale, on the same principle that doctors\n",
      "and lawyers are paid whether they gain or lose a case. In extent and\n",
      "profit, the business varies from the itinerant vender with half a dozen\n",
      "patents in his valise to the established business house with\n",
      "sub-agencies in all parts of the world. What the profits are in the\n",
      "latter situation may be judged from a single case in the former, where a\n",
      "traveling man received as commission on a single patent sold the sum of\n",
      "$5,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "289. COMMISSION MERCHANTS.--A vast business is done in the sale of\n",
      "general merchandise on commission. Foreign houses have their agencies in\n",
      "this city. Also much of the produce of the farm and of the products of\n",
      "manufactures are disposed of in the same way. Take a case of the former\n",
      "kind. A man hires an office in New York and storage in a warehouse. Then\n",
      "he sends circulars to Westerndealers, stating that he is prepared to\n",
      "take their stock or grain on commission. When he can make quick sales he\n",
      "saves the expense of storage, but rental in a warehouse is necessary in\n",
      "holding for futures. He receives in one day 100,000 bushels of wheat at\n",
      "seventy-five cents per bushel, which, after paying freightage, he sells\n",
      "at one half of one per cent. profit. Gain of one day, $500. He will not\n",
      "receive so much every day, and some days he will have to sell at a loss;\n",
      "but, taken altogether, there are good chances of wealth in the\n",
      "commission business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "290. INSURANCE AGENCY.--Insurance, both fire and life, is a mine of\n",
      "wealth, and has opened wondrously during the last few years. The present\n",
      "magnitude of the business is shown by the statement that there are\n",
      "$2,500,000,000 invested in life insurance in the United States, while\n",
      "the fire insurance agents last year wrote more than $16,000,000,000.\n",
      "There are seven men who have an aggregate of $7,000,000 on their lives.\n",
      "But the business is yet in its infancy. The field of life insurance is\n",
      "not nearly covered, and if it were, ten million persons will come to\n",
      "maturity during the next ten years, all of whom may be considered as\n",
      "candidates for insurance, and all the policies will have to be renewed\n",
      "in a short time. Insurance agents receive as commission from ten to\n",
      "twenty-five per cent. Some companies secure to their agents a regular\n",
      "percentage on the premium so long as the policies continue in force. If,\n",
      "therefore, an agent gets fifteen per cent. commission, and the company\n",
      "receives $10,000 per year as premiums from the policies he has written,\n",
      "his share will be $1,500; and thus he enjoys an annuity without any\n",
      "further work for a long period of time. The larger old-time companies,\n",
      "also, have general agents whose positions are still more lucrative. Many\n",
      "of them are in circumstances of affluence, and have very little to do.\n",
      "In fact, it is in the insurance business as in many other occupations,\n",
      "that as one rises the salaries are larger, and the actual work, aside\n",
      "from the responsibility, is smaller.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "291. TRAVELING SALESMAN.--In some houses a traveling salesman is allowed\n",
      "a standing commission on all goods bought by firms whose custom was\n",
      "secured through his influence. As the commission continues as long as\n",
      "the customer continues the trade at that house, some agents, after a few\n",
      "years of active work are enabled to retire on incomes of $2,000, $3,000,\n",
      "and in some cases of $5,000 a year. The business done by drummers is\n",
      "immense. Three hundred million tons of goods are shipped by them yearly,\n",
      "and the business amounts to nearly $2,000,000 a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "292. SUPPLY COMPANIES.--A supply company differs from an ordinary\n",
      "merchants’ firm in that it does not keep goods in stock. It is a mammoth\n",
      "general agency for procuring whatsoever you desire. Specimens only are\n",
      "kept in the store, and from these the customers make selections. The\n",
      "advantage of supply companies is the saving of large rentals, of\n",
      "expensive clerk-hire, and of loss or damage in the long keeping of\n",
      "goods, and, most of all, of risk in unsalable articles, and in the fall\n",
      "of prices. Thus, a supply company can undersell an ordinary dealer, and\n",
      "if alert and prompt can make vast profits. Another great advantage is\n",
      "the smallness of the capital required. Here are great opportunities for\n",
      "bright young business men of limited means.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "293. AGENCIES FOR TEACHERS.--The number of teachers in the public\n",
      "schools in the United States is 400,325. The matter of engaging school\n",
      "teachers varies in different States, and often in different parts of\n",
      "the same State. Sometimes it is done by county superintendents, often\n",
      "by the Board of Education, but most frequently by the school trustees,\n",
      "commissioners, or committees. One going into the business of a Teachers’\n",
      "Agency must ascertain the particular method in every part of the\n",
      "country, and learn the name of the persons authorized to act in that\n",
      "capacity. Then he should issue circulars by the hundred thousand. For\n",
      "the eyes of applicants, he should use the advertising pages of the\n",
      "newspapers. Teachers should be charged a commission upon their salaries\n",
      "in something like the following order: Five per cent. on first year’s\n",
      "salary, three per cent. the second year, and one per cent. the third\n",
      "year. After that it may be allowed to lapse. The contract should be\n",
      "rigorously drawn, and, where possible, payments should be collected in\n",
      "advance. There are great profits in the business when systematically and\n",
      "vigorously conducted. One agency in the eastern part of the United\n",
      "States is receiving commissions from ten thousand school teachers. Owing\n",
      "to frequent changes, the majority of these are paying five per cent.;\n",
      "but if we suppose the average to be only the amount payable the second\n",
      "year--$3 commission--the income would be $30,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "294. CLERICAL AGENCY.--Here is an opportunity for an unoccupied\n",
      "clergyman of wide clerical acquaintance. There are thousands of vacant\n",
      "pulpits and other thousands of ministers anxious for calls. Establish an\n",
      "agency through whose medium the supply shall meet the demand. Your list\n",
      "should comprise the names of all churchless pastors, together with those\n",
      "desirous of change; and their experience, qualifications, education,\n",
      "family, age, personal appearance, together with other interesting\n",
      "information, should be properly tabulated for the inspection of church\n",
      "committees. Candidates should be graded according to the catalogue, and\n",
      "sent out in order as pulpit candidates. As clerical engagements are\n",
      "commonly much longer than those of teachers, it is right that you should\n",
      "receive a larger per cent. for your services. If a church pays its\n",
      "pastor a salary of $10,000, and you are successful in the search for an\n",
      "available man for its pulpit, it would hardly be a presumption for you\n",
      "to charge $500 for your services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "295. MATRIMONIAL AGENCIES.--These should be conducted with the greatest\n",
      "care, and only by the most conscientious persons, on account of the\n",
      "great responsibilities involved. They are, however, capable of vast\n",
      "development, and of immense good. In Massachusetts alone there are\n",
      "seventy thousand females in excess of the males, while in Illinois the\n",
      "men preponderate to the number of fifty thousand. Your task of bringing\n",
      "together the unmated is a most delicate one, and you should accordingly\n",
      "be well compensated. Where there is much wealth on either side, your\n",
      "commission may be expressed in three figures, and even in four. One\n",
      "thousand dollars is a small sum for a man to pay who secures an\n",
      "accomplished wife and a happy home. We have known several marriages made\n",
      "in this way to turn out exceedingly well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "296. AGENCY FOR SERVANTS.--This is not new, but you might revolutionize\n",
      "it by a new plan. Written recommendations are worthless, because almost\n",
      "every one will compensate the disappointment of the discharged servant\n",
      "by a certificate of good behavior, in the writing of which the\n",
      "elasticity of the conscience is more or less drawn upon. Instead of\n",
      "accepting a valueless paper, let an employee of the office personally\n",
      "visit two or three of the places where the servant has been employed.\n",
      "The lady of the house will tell you many things she would not write in\n",
      "the letter. This will consume time, but the compensation is in the\n",
      "better class of service you will be enabled to offer. When it is known\n",
      "that you make personal investigation, sifting out the useless and\n",
      "offering only first-class help, your patronage will be vastly increased,\n",
      "and you can charge much higher commissions. Tell your patron that at the\n",
      "end of a month she may pay you $10 if satisfied; and most people would\n",
      "prefer to do that than to pay a half or quarter of that sum in advance\n",
      "with small guarantee of fitness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "297. AGENCY FOR FARM HANDS.--There are thousands of idle people in the\n",
      "great cities who would gladly go on farms for a portion of the year. If\n",
      "they make personal application, they are commonly regarded by the farmer\n",
      "as tramps. Besides these, there are thousands of emigrants arriving in\n",
      "search of work. Many of them are valuable as farm help, having tilled\n",
      "the soil at home. An agent who has a keen knowledge of human nature, and\n",
      "knows how to ask questions, sifting out the useless and the vicious from\n",
      "the valuable and the virtuous, can through proper advertising in\n",
      "agricultural papers, send at least a thousand of these men into the\n",
      "country every summer. Through an arrangement with the farmer by which $5\n",
      "of the first month’s wages shall be withheld and forwarded to the agent,\n",
      "the sum of $5,000 as commission for these one thousand laborers is\n",
      "secured. But the energetic agent ought to do far better than this.\n",

      "Owners of proprietary compounds have built up great fortunes in the sale\n",
      "of their concoctions. Our drug stores are filled with patent medicines,\n",
      "and millions of “cures” are sold annually. The names of some of these,\n",
      "such as Hostetter, Brandreth, and Mother Winslow, have become household\n",
      "words, proving how largely and universally their medicines have sold.\n",
      "The story is told of one credulous hypochondriac, who, on the theory\n",
      "that of many shot some one is likely to hit, actually took every kind of\n",
      "patent medicine in the world, or at least of every sort he had heard\n",
      "about. As there are more than three hundred and sixty diverse\n",
      "concoctions, this genius must have taken a different kind for every day\n",
      "of the year, or else have extended his experiments through a long\n",
      "period, which seems impossible under the circumstances. It is said that\n",
      "Perry Davis obtained his famous “Discovery” in the form of a recipe in\n",
      "an old newspaper which he found in an outhouse. This was the foundation\n",
      "of one of the largest fortunes in patent medicines, and it was the\n",
      "parent of all the “Killers.” The men who have made their piles in\n",
      "“pills” may be counted by the hundred. Perhaps the “Soothing Syrup”\n",
      "success is the most signal example of “_multum in parvo_.” It is sold by\n",
      "the million bottles, and yet it is nothing but a little paregoric\n",
      "dropped in some sweet mixture. “Lubec” is a mighty name, but anybody can\n",
      "be a Lubec so far as the question of perfumery goes. Among the anecdotes\n",
      "of medicine venders we have only space for one or two. A man was crying\n",
      "up the virtues of an electric belt, and it was found that he had\n",
      "adroitly attached a strip of mustard plaster to the magic band, and this\n",
      "when heated by contact with the warm skin produced redness and an\n",
      "itching, which were supposed by the too trusting patient to be the\n",
      "effects of the healing electricity. Another man has made a fortune with\n",
      "an “Indian Plant.” He travels about the country with what he advertises\n",
      "to be a “troop of Indians,” giving performances and hawking his “cures.”\n",
      "The “Indians” are New York toughs, and the “medicine plant” is a common\n",
      "pasture weed. We give no sort of countenance to these frauds, but,\n",
      "dismissing them all, there are still both profit to the patient and\n",
      "profit to the maker in the taking of proprietary medicines. To succeed\n",
      "in this line one should first have an article of genuine merit, and then\n",
      "advertise lavishly. Below are given some recipes quite as good as those\n",
      "that have made fortunes for their possessors, and in some cases the\n",
      "exact formulas of these widely renowned medicines are given.\n",

      "composed of these simple ingredients: Butter, lard, Venice turpentine,\n",
      "white wax and yellow wax. Here is a rule for another ointment: Fresh\n",
      "butter, three-quarters pound; beeswax, four ounces; yellow resin, three\n",

      "simmer the whole with constant agitation for ten or twelve minutes, or\n",

      "drops; again stir well, allow mixture to settle; and when about half\n",
      "cold pour into pots previously slightly warmed, and allow it to cool\n",

      "the property. Tax methods in large cities are often ways that are dark.\n",
      "For this reason, George Gould, the multi-millionaire, and Mr.\n",

      "321. CITY PROPERTY.--A mile and a half of millionaires! Midway between\n",
      "the East River and the Hudson there lay a few years ago a neglected\n",
      "tract of land which could have been bought for a few hundred thousand\n",
      "dollars. To-day it is the wealthiest mile and a half on the Western\n",
      "continent. One hundred million dollars would not purchase the ground\n",
      "alone. Forty years ago a piece of land which is now almost “down-town”\n",
      "was called “Eno’s Folly,” because he paid for it what was supposed to be\n",
      "an extravagant sum. It is now the site of the Fifth Avenue Hotel. The\n",
      "tide is still running up, but you must now go to the Bronx, or even\n",

      "322. PLEASURE RESORTS.--Less than forty years ago a man, simulating\n",
      "country simplicity, sauntered along Coney Island and astonished the\n",
      "owners by inquiring the price of what was supposed to be worthless land.\n",
      "They, thinking him crazy or a fool, named a thousand dollars, or five\n",

      "Bergen Beach has made a fortune in this way during the last two or three\n",
      "years. As cities grow, pleasure resorts must be found. Buy a bit of\n",
      "seashore and make it into a Bergen Beach or a Bowery Bay. Or, purchase a\n",
      "grove within easy distance of the city, and make it into a pleasure\n",
      "park. In either case, railroads or trolley connection is indispensable,\n",
      "but with these and plenty of enterprise and money you cannot fail to\n",
      "reap a large harvest.\n",

      "sagacity to see a potential factor in the meeting of two rivers, or the\n",
      "projection of a railroad. The question for investors in real estate is,\n",
      "“Where is the population going?” Keen observers note the drift, get\n",
      "ahead of the tide, and are ready to sell lots when the people arrive.\n",
      "Whitestone and Morris Park on Long Island were built in this way. It is\n",

      "handsomely where the projector is fortunate in his location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "324. WESTERN LANDS.--Fortunes have been made and lost in Western lands.\n",
      "The facts are that some sharpers have been booming lands that are hardly\n",
      "worth the taxes. Persons who have bought “corner lots” in “promising”\n",
      "Western towns have been surprised to learn that the towns were not\n",
      "built, or even surveyed, and that often the site was located in the\n",
      "midst of an impenetrable swamp where a town was impossible. However,\n",

      "facilities on the banks of rivers are good investments.\n",

      "evolution of the flat, is becoming a feature of life in large cities.\n",
      "The question whether it is a paying property will receive light by the\n",
      "consideration of the rents received by the owners of a building of this\n",

      "height. Some are twenty stories, one is thirty, and it is reported that\n",
      "a sky-scraper fifty stories in height is projected. Do they pay? Here is\n",
      "the account of a modest one of only nine stories, the Mills Building on\n",
      "William Street, New York. The cost, with land, was $2,500,000. It is 175\n",
      "× 150 feet. It contains 400 offices, has 1,200 tenants, and pays an\n",
      "annual net rental of $200,000, or eight per cent. It is related of Mr.\n",
      "D. O. Mills, the owner, that in completing his magnificent residence on\n",
      "upper Fifth Avenue, he gave a _carte blanche_ order to a decorator, and\n",
      "departed with his family to California. On returning he was delighted to\n",
      "find the place transformed into an Aladdin’s Palace, but his joy was\n",
      "somewhat modified at the presentation of the bill which amounted to\n",
      "$450,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "327. THE JERSEY FLATS.--Right over against property whose taxable value\n",
      "is $3,000,000,000 lies another property worth literally nothing. Step\n",
      "over from Manhattan Island, where every foot of land needs to be\n",
      "overlaid with silver round-moons for its purchase, to New Jersey, and\n",
      "you will find 27,000 acres of marsh lying under the very nose of the\n",
      "metropolis--land hardly worth a song. Why is this? Simply because\n",
      "capitalists have not been wise enough to improve this great waste. In\n",
      "Holland, by a system of diking, land in a similar condition is now\n",
      "covered by great warehouses and factories, and cannot be bought for\n",
      "hundreds of millions of dollars. Here is the opportunity for\n",
      "capitalists. Why invest money in far-off gold fields when you have a\n",
      "Klondike here at the very threshold of the metropolis? “The first step,”\n",
      "says the State geologist, “is to build an embankment and a pumping\n",
      "station. The cost will be about $1,000,000. The main ditches should be\n",
      "made, and the whole area laid out in twenty-acre farms, and sold on the\n",
      "express condition that each plot shall be immediately ditched and\n",
      "brought under cultivation.” If we put the cost of ditching, and of other\n",
      "incidental expenses at $500,000, we have a total cost of $1,500,000.\n",
      "Then, if we estimate the worth of the land at only one-fourth the\n",
      "average price of land on Manhattan Island--which is the average worth of\n",
      "land in Jersey City--we have a value for the total 27,000 acres of\n",

      "329. CRAYON WORK.--A teacher in the Cooper Institute says: “During the\n",
      "previous year forty of my pupils in art have made $7,000, or $175 each,\n",
      "while learning the art of crayon-photography. Every year one hundred\n",

      "and another has been appointed manager of a decorative art society in\n",

      "much more by private tuition.\n",

      "331. PHOTOGRAPH COLORING.--“A little girl,” says Mr. Cooper, “came to my\n",
      "house to thank me for what she had learned at the Institute.” “I have\n",
      "earned $300 coloring photographs,” she said with enthusiasm. The\n",

      "women, and there is no prospect that the market will become glutted.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "332. OIL PAINTING.--A man in middle life met Mr. Cooper on the stairs of\n",
      "the Institute. “My daughter,” he said, “makes $1,300 a year by teaching\n",
      "painting, and I never earned more than $1,200 myself.” The chief points\n",
      "of oil painting are a _good tooth_ (a canvas which will take color from\n",
      "a brush readily), perspective, fineness of touch, delicate perception,\n",
      "an eye for shades of color, and a bold, free hand. Oil paintings bring\n",
      "from $5 to $50,000, according to merit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "333. WATER COLORS.--Paintings in water colors are popular because less\n",
      "expensive than those done in oil. Good work in this department is,\n",
      "however, well paid. Much depends upon the subject and its treatment. It\n",
      "is said that the artist, Mr. John LaFarge, sold about $15,000 worth of\n",
      "water colors last year.\n",
      "\n",

      "rich as a queen. I have thirty pupils in wood engraving.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "335. BOOK DECORATION.--Publishers of books, and especially of magazines,\n",
      "pay large prices for decorations for the covers, title pages, and other\n",
      "important parts. The secret of success is in the design. If you can find\n",
      "a happy idea, you will get a large price for it. Of course, the point in\n",
      "most cases is to illustrate the subject-matter. A unique conception,\n",
      "happily worked out, will give both fame and money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "336. DYEING.--This may not be thought one of the fine arts, but it\n",
      "requires a skill hardly inferior to that of the painter or sculptor.\n",
      "There is a large field in the recoloring of tapestries, silks, and\n",
      "woolen goods. The requisites of success are taste, a good eye for color,\n",
      "knowledge of dye-stuffs, and indefatigable industry in finding a market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "337. DESIGNS.--These are constantly in demand. Wall paper manufacturers,\n",
      "dressmakers, architects, builders, home decorators, carpet\n",
      "manufacturers, fine-art workers, all want designs. An ordinary\n",
      "kaleidoscope will furnish you thousands of suggestions every day. From\n",
      "these select a few of the best and work them on a fine, white drawing\n",
      "paper. Have a separate folio for each department of drawings, and\n",
      "advertise what you are doing. If you have a real talent for the work,\n",
      "and a show-window, you cannot fail of success in any large town.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "338. ENGRAVING ON GLASS.--By the use of the wheel this becomes easy\n",
      "work. The chief fields for its operation are in summer resorts where\n",
      "people wish to carry away a souvenir of the place. One who knows how to\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "339. EMBROIDERY.--This is one of the simplest of the arts. The only\n",
      "capital required is a ball of worsted, the only tool a needle, and the\n",
      "only instruction a few elementary rules that can be quickly learned. The\n",
      "demand depends upon the skill. A small store can be cheaply stocked, and\n",
      "its contents sold at a good profit if the articles are unique.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "340. LACE MAKING.--Our valuable laces are chiefly imported, but there is\n",
      "no reason why work equally good should not be done at home. An immense\n",
      "field yet to be developed is American-made needle-point lace. Get a book\n",
      "on the subject and study it theoretically. Then take lessons of a maker.\n",
      "The book will give you suggestions and enable you, after you have\n",
      "learned the business, to strike out in various directions independently\n",
      "of your teachers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "341. DRAWING IN CHARCOAL.--This is a rapid, facile, and effective method\n",
      "for sketching. The drawings are more especially in demand in summer\n",
      "cottages, tents, and in whatever places lodgings are temporary, and\n",
      "where lodgers dislike the trouble of shipping costly paintings. You can\n",
      "find a ready market for good work at any mountain or seaside resort.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "342. PAINTING ON CHINA.--This is becoming very popular. Few kinds of art\n",
      "pay better than china-firing. The outfit will cost from $15 to $50,\n",
      "according to the size of the kiln, but the pleasure and profit will be\n",
      "worth many hundreds of dollars. If you live in a country town, put your\n",
      "wares in a prominent store, and they will be sure to attract attention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "343. PORTRAIT PAINTING.--This is profitable if you can secure sufficient\n",
      "custom. The difficulty is to get the flesh tones, the expression, and\n",
      "the proper degree of illumination. Last year, there were thirty young\n",
      "women in Cooper Institute learning the art, and one-fifth of the number\n",

      "foundation of a great fortune. Another fascinating chapter on\n",
      "manufacture is the “Story of Pullman,” which reads like a fairy tale,\n",
      "but is all strictly true. Mr. Pullman began in a small way to build\n",
      "parlor cars, making one or two as an experiment. The traveling public\n",
      "were quick to appreciate the luxury, and Mr. P. had to enlarge his works\n",

      "natural position of the hairs. When the glue is dry and hard, hold the\n",
      "hairs so firmly as to allow the natural skin to be peeled off. Now you\n",
      "can apply the artificial skin by pouring over the hairs liquid\n",
      "India-rubber, boiled drying-oils, or other waterproof substances, which\n",
      "on drying will form a continuous membrane supporting the hairs. The glue\n",
      "is then removed by steeping the fur in warm water. This plan has the\n",
      "double advantage that the fur so prepared is moth-proof, and the old\n",
      "skin can be used for the manufacture of leather.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "346. MICA SHEETS.--Large sheets of mica command a great price. There are\n",
      "only a few places where the mineral can be mined in sheets of one foot\n",
      "square or larger, but the vast heaps of waste mica can be utilized by\n",
      "building up the sheets artificially. This can be done by treating it\n",
      "with shellac. There are fortunes in waste mica quarries for those who\n",
      "know how to utilize the countless tons of fragments. The field is\n",
      "especially promising in North Carolina and Georgia, where immense\n",
      "quarries abound.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "347. ARTIFICIAL MARBLE.--There is room for profitable investment in the\n",
      "manufacture of any article which is procured from nature at great\n",
      "expense. This is the case with marble. It is scarce at best; the\n",
      "quarries are remote from the centers of population, and the mining and\n",
      "transportation make it a very costly article. Marble can be manufactured\n",
      "by imitating nature’s processes--the percolating of water through chalk.\n",
      "The popular verde antique can be made by an application of an oxide of\n",
      "copper. The slices of marble are then placed in another bath, where they\n",
      "are hardened and crystallized, coming out exactly like the real article.\n",
      "In Italy, a fine black marble is made from common white sandstone. The\n",
      "manufacture is carried on by the owners of the local gasworks, who thus\n",
      "reap a double profit from their plant. Here is a hint for American\n",
      "manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "348. ARTIFICIAL WHALEBONE.--Whalebone is in great demand. It is worth\n",
      "from $3 to $4 per pound. No artificial substance has as yet been found\n",
      "to take its place, but we are surely on the eve of that discovery. No\n",
      "one substance is at the same time so hard and so elastic, but\n",
      "experimenters will yet find a combination which will answer the purpose.\n",
      "One has already been found which draws the surplus demand when the\n",
      "genuine article cannot be obtained. The inventor who can advance another\n",
      "step and produce an exact imitation will have the whalebone market in\n",
      "his hands. This field is rich with possibilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "P. S.--Since writing the above we have the secret. Here it is: Treat the\n",
      "rawhide with sulphide of sodium, remove the hair, immerse the hide\n",
      "twenty-six to thirty-four hours in a weak solution of double sulphate of\n",
      "potassa, and stretch it upon a frame or table, in order that it may not\n",
      "contract in drying. The desiccation is allowed to proceed in broad\n",
      "daylight, and the hide is then exposed to a temperature of fifty to\n",
      "sixty degrees. The influence of the light, combined with the action of\n",
      "the double sulphate of potassa absorbed by the skin, renders the\n",
      "gelatine insoluble in water, and prevents putrefaction, the moisture\n",
      "being completely expelled. Thus prepared, the skin is submitted to a\n",
      "strong pressure, which gives to it almost the hardness and elasticity\n",
      "which characterize the genuine whalebone, with the advantage that before\n",
      "or after the process of desiccation any color desired may be imparted to\n",
      "it by means of a dye bath.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "349. ARTIFICIAL INDIA RUBBER.--A man while experimenting recently with\n",
      "cottonseed oil for the production of a varnish, obtained to his\n",
      "surprise, not a varnish, but a rubber. By its use, with fifteen per\n",
      "cent. of genuine rubber, an article can be produced so exactly like the\n",
      "real as to defy detection. The process is so simple that a patent is not\n",
      "obtainable. So, manufacturers, the field is open. Rubber is high and in\n",
      "great demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "350. ARTIFICIAL CAMPHOR.--Here is another trade secret. The genuine\n",
      "camphor is scarce. The artificial is made in England, shipped to\n",
      "Hamburg, and then re-shipped to England as the real article. Here is the\n",
      "way it is made: Pass a current of dry hydrochloric acid gas through\n",
      "spirits of turpentine cooled by a freezing mixture. The liquid deposits\n",
      "crystals, which are dissolved in alcohol and precipitated by water. The\n",
      "separated crystals are drained and dried. They are perfectly colorless,\n",
      "with an odor like camphor. At the ordinary temperature, its vapor\n",
      "tension is sufficient to cause it to sublime like ordinary camphor in\n",
      "small brilliant crystals in the bottles in which it is preserved. It is\n",
      "insoluble in water, and gyrates when on the surface of that liquid like\n",
      "true camphor.\n",

      "351. CAR BUILDING.--Some day another Pullman will arise, but with\n",
      "developments in car building in a totally different direction. We quote\n",
      "from a recent magazine article: “The time is sure to come when a new\n",
      "railroad genius will arise and make an end of the game of brag between\n",
      "American general passenger agents. This reformer will probably\n",
      "substitute light and easily cleaned bamboo seats for those now in use;\n",
      "he will save a good deal of the money now spent in useless\n",
      "ornamentation, and spend it in better ventilation and lighting; and he\n",
      "is likely to design frames and trucks much lighter, and at least as\n",
      "strong and durable, as those which carry the average day car of the\n",
      "present time. It is possible, too, that he may accomplish a good result\n",
      "by lowering the center of gravity of the prevailing type of passenger\n",
      "car, thus preventing it from rolling at high rates of speed, and\n",
      "obviating the supposed necessity of placing two or three tons of old\n",
      "rails in the floor to keep it steady.” It is perhaps needless to say\n",
      "that such a man as Mr. Pullman or Mr. Wagner will become a\n",
      "multi-millionaire through this much-needed reform.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "352. THE TRANSVERSE WOODEN PAVEMENT.--One day the celebrated wit,\n",
      "Sidney Smith, was talking with some vestrymen of the church of which he\n",
      "was a member about laying a wooden pavement around the sacred edifice.\n",
      "“Well,” said the famous jester, “we have but to lay our heads together\n",
      "and the thing is done.” But here is a pavement which some capitalists\n",

      "no joke. It has been ascertained that the most durable pavement is made\n",
      "from blocks of wood sawed transversely about twelve inches in thickness.\n",

      "hidden wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "353. NEVADA SILVER.--The Comstock lode produced in three years\n",
      "$100,000,000, of which $30,000,000 went for cost and working expenses,\n",
      "and $70,000,000 for profits. Altogether $300,000,000 have been taken\n",
      "from that celebrated mine. In the African mines there are sixty-nine\n",
      "companies. In 1896 the lowest dividend of any of these companies was 10\n",
      "per cent., and the highest 350. In 1897 the lowest was 10 and the\n",

      "silver mines reads like the fascinating story of a popular novel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "354. ALUMINUM, THE NEW MINERAL.--“The product of aluminum in the United\n",
      "States,” says a mining expert, “should be three million pounds in 1900.”\n",
      "The present price is from thirty-five to fifty cents per pound. It is\n",
      "found chiefly in Georgia and Alabama at the foot of the Appalachian\n",
      "system, but there is no known reason why it should not be discovered in\n",
      "other parts--the mountains of Tennessee, North Carolina, and\n",
      "Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "355. NORTH CAROLINA MICA.--In the mountains of North Carolina are found\n",
      "the best mica dikes in the United States, but the methods of mining are\n",
      "crude and bring small profit. Here is an opportunity to make a vast\n",
      "fortune by the producing of mica with machinery such as is used in\n",
      "extracting other minerals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "356. KANSAS ZINC.--Zinc is a mineral which has a great future. It is\n",
      "being used largely in place of tin. There are many zinc mines, and\n",
      "especially in the Western States, as yet undeveloped. One acre in\n",
      "Galena, Kansas, produced $250,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "357. MISSOURI COTTAS.--For clay go to Missouri. It is found in 90 out of\n",
      "the 114 counties of the State. From this mineral three companies in\n",
      "Kansas City are manufacturing sewer-pipes and working on an invested\n",
      "capital of $1,000,000. They have an annual output worth $1,100,000, or\n",

      "The sewer-pipe industry will vastly increase with the growth of cities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "358. NICKEL MINES.--Nickel is a metal for which there is a constantly\n",
      "increasing demand. Aside from the vast number of nickel-plated articles,\n",
      "it has recently been found that steel, alloyed with a small percentage\n",
      "of nickel, makes the hardest substance known which can be produced on a\n",
      "large scale. It is bound to be used in future for the shells of our\n",

      "valuable ore awaiting the hardy miner or bold speculator.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "359. MEXICAN IRON.--Near the city of Durango, Mexico, are the largest\n",
      "iron mines in North America, but as yet entirely unworked. There are\n",

      "360. TENNESSEE LIMESTONE.--In the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains\n",
      "are ranges of blocks--lower Carbonifererous and Devonian shales, and\n",
      "impure limestone, but the rocks of the basin proper are pure limestone.\n",
      "This limestone when pulverized makes the best phosphate, and is worth\n",
      "$18 a ton. A mining authority states that with proper working it ought\n",
      "to produce at least 200,000 tons of rock per annum.\n",

      "Almost all the mines of the Lake Michigan region are making profit, but\n",
      "the industry is yet in its infancy. When it is known that a mine has\n",
      "been made to pay which contains less than one per cent. of copper, it\n",

      "years ago on Long Island not far from Brooklyn. Present supplies come\n",
      "from Sal Mountain, Georgia, and from Wyoming. It is believed that the\n",
      "serpentine rocks in Western North Carolina, as well as similar rocks in\n",
      "California and Oregon, contain rich deposits of this mineral.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "368. PROSPECTS IN PLATINUM.--This is a metal of very great importance.\n",
      "It has not thus far been found in large quantities in the United States.\n",
      "The most promising field is the North Pacific Slope, following the line\n",
      "of the coast mountains. Some day, it is thought, that rich platinum\n",
      "mines may be discovered there equal to those in Russia, and, of course,\n",
      "the early prospectors will reap large fortunes.\n",

      "369. PETROLEUM WELLS.--“Petroleum,” says a leading article in the\n",
      "_Electrical World_, “is the coming fuel.” It is believed by many that\n",
      "the excitement over the discovery of oil fields in Pennsylvania in 1865\n",
      "will be repeated on a much larger scale in oil regions yet to be\n",
      "discovered in the far West. At present, the mountains of Wyoming appear\n",
      "to be the most promising field. To sink an oil well costs $500 on the\n",
      "average. On Oil Creek, Pennsylvania, a few wells have been struck which\n",
      "yielded 3,000 barrels a day. One of the quickest ways to accumulate a\n",
      "fortune is to prospect for oil, and when a rich vein is struck to buy as\n",
      "much land as you can. A young man named Johnny Steel once owned nearly\n",
      "all the land where the Pennsylvania oil wells were discovered. His\n",
      "income was over $1,000,000 a year, $30,000 a day, or about $2 a minute.\n",
      "But, verifying the adage that “a fool and his money are soon parted,” he\n",
      "not only spent all this enormous income, but also squandered the entire\n",
      "principal, and came at last to work as the driver of an oil wagon on the\n",
      "very oil farm he had once owned.\n",

      "have inclosed what is known as the great gold belt of the United States.\n",
      "Nearly all the gold has been discovered within these comparatively\n",
      "narrow limits. Cripple Creek produced $8,000,000 in four years. A man\n",

      "frozen British possessions, promises to do as well as any gold discovery\n",
      "in the United States. Two men, the Thorpe brothers, cleaned up with\n",
      "their pans $13,000 in eight weeks. This was but a very small part of the\n",
      "immense amount of gold found in an insignificant creek, but there are at\n",

      "mammoth fortunes, has often consisted in little more than the set of\n",
      "stools and the cost of the patent. Of course, there must be brains and\n",
      "hard thinking. The sale of articles protected by patent rights is a\n",
      "stimulus to invent them, and has been the source of fortunes for more\n",
      "people in the United States than in any other country in the world. The\n",
      "United States Patent Office issues every year about 25,000 patents, and\n",
      "the number is constantly increasing. Nor are the patentees in all, or\n",
      "even in a majority of cases, men of genius, or persons who have been\n",
      "learned in the occupations in which they have achieved distinction. The\n",
      "greater part of them have been issued to persons in humble walks of\n",

      "In every department of human industry there are possibilities of\n",

      "harvester, known all over the world. His patents made him a millionaire.\n",
      "Charles Goodyear accidentally mixed a bit of rubber and sulphur on a red\n",
      "hot stove. The result set him to thinking. He discovered the process of\n",
      "vulcanization, which is the basis of the great rubber industry\n",
      "throughout the world. His patents made him enormously rich. Elias Howe\n",
      "wondered if there could not be some better way of sewing than by the\n",
      "bone and muscle of weary woman’s hand. He tried and tried in vain. At\n",
      "last he had a dream in which he saw a needle with the eye at the point\n",
      "instead of at the head. He awoke exclaiming, “I have it!” The result was\n",
      "the sewing machine. Mr. Howe received every year more than $100,000\n",
      "royalties on his patent needle. Eli Whitney, watching some slaves\n",
      "cleaning cotton, set to work to find a better way. He invented the\n",
      "cotton-gin by which one machine performs the labor of five thousand\n",
      "persons. This invention reaped for him untold wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "These were men of genius, but there are inventions which, being simple,\n",
      "lie apparently within the reach of all men. Mr. Parker, whose invention\n",
      "of the tobacco box fastening, is nothing but a “bulge and a dent,” and\n",
      "which it would seem any child might have thought out, made an immense\n",
      "fortune. Another inventor obtained a patent for a washing machine, and\n",

      "where they can be evaporated in a vacuum, the vapor to be drawn off by a\n",
      "pump and condensed. As soon as the mass has the consistency of a syrup\n",

      "lower end of the neck when it is full.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "530. FISHERMAN’S CLAW.--A large, steel claw somewhat on the principle of\n",
      "a net, but with many advantages, might be invented. The claw when opened\n",
      "should cover three or four square yards of water. It closes with a\n",
      "spring attached to the handle. Quite as much sport in this as with the\n",
      "hook and line. The right article ought to have great sales.\n",

      "children’s money a bank with a device attached for registering the\n",
      "amount which it contains. A cheap device of this kind would be a great\n",
      "improvement on the present toy bank. The inventor of one of the\n",
      "principal banks for children now in use is said to have made half a\n",
      "million dollars out of his invention.\n",

      "paper and using it for a lighter could be utilized by an inventor in the\n",
      "manufacture of matches,” says the _National Druggist_. “The invention\n",
      "would revolutionize match manufacturing, because the wood for this\n",
      "purpose is constantly growing scarcer and more costly. The matches would\n",
      "be considerably cheaper than the wooden ones, and also weigh less, a\n",
      "fact which counts for much in the exportation.”\n",

      "to put the inventor on the high road to fortune. Why could not our\n",
      "newspaper-type, by the use of phosphorous, after the manner of the\n",
      "illuminated watch dial, be illumined so that the print could be read in\n",

      "glass, its many other advantages would make it an El Dorado for the\n",
      "inventor. Its lightness in transportation and its freedom from breakage\n",
      "would cause it to come into general use. Especially on shipboard, where\n",
      "bottles are constantly broken by the roll of the vessel, would such an\n",
      "invention be hailed with joy.\n",
      "\n",

      "536. THE PAPER SAIL.--“Paper sails,” says the _Railway Review_, “are\n",
      "meeting with considerable favor. They are cheaper than canvas sails,\n",
      "and they are soft, flexible, and as untearable as the original article.”\n",
      "There is room for invention here. Treated with the proper solutions, it\n",
      "may be that paper will entirely displace cloth in the wings of our\n",

      "538. PHOSPHORESCENT STREET NUMBERS.--Who has not been vexed in trying to\n",
      "locate an unfamiliar house in the dark? In many streets not one number\n",

      "\n",
      "542. NAILLESS HORSE SHOE.--A rubber shoe, which can be easily adjusted\n",

      "552. FROST PROTECTOR.--A chemical combination whose product when ignited\n",
      "is chiefly smoke. All farmers suffer from late and early frosts. They\n",
      "would pay liberally for a smoke producer which would protect their\n",
      "crops, for it is known that a very little smoke acts as a mantle to keep\n",

      "of the field so as to keep the wires taut. If the field is large or\n",
      "irregular, more windlasses would be required, but they could be\n",
      "manufactured at a cost much less than that of posts.\n",
      "\n",

      "an accident to the rope occur, the articles of food are often spilled,\n",
      "thus spoiling the water in the well, and entailing great annoyance and\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "577. DOUBLE POSTAL CARD.--The United States Government would no doubt\n",
      "consider favorably a postal-card made double, so that one part could be\n",

      "letter paper can be fed out to the writer as desired, so that the pen or\n",
      "machine may travel continuously without stopping for new sheets.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "581. INK REGULATOR.--An inkstand provided with a tiny wooden disk which\n",
      "floats on the surface of the ink. The slightest touch of the pen\n",
      "depresses the disk and permits the pen to be filled, and at the same\n",

      "\n",
      "584. PERPETUAL PEN SUPPLY.--On a slight elevation have an inkstand with\n",
      "an opening at the bottom to which is attached a small piece of hose, the\n",
      "other end being connected with a hollow pen holder, thus insuring a\n",
      "perpetual flow of ink. A saucer on the writing table containing a tiny\n",

      "the ordinary way.\n",
      "\n",

      "instantly, and yet be separable when desired. You would not have lost\n",
      "the train but for the delay in fixing your collar and tie. Thousands of\n",
      "minutes saved every day mean as many thousands of dollars in the pockets\n",
      "of the fortunate inventor.\n",

      "kinds of weather, and whether the hair is long or short.\n",

      "the back instead of from the top would have the double advantage of ease\n",
      "of adjustment and elegant appearance. The buttons or lacings would then\n",
      "all be upon the sides. There is a possibility of much money here.\n",

      "use than the umbrella, and yet what a cumbersome, awkward thing it is.\n",
      "Who will invent one that can be folded, packed and pocketed? A Mr.\n",

      "pad, so that the engagements for the day may be marked upon a paper\n",
      "opposite the time fixed. The pad should have a sufficient number of\n",

      "hand, there are few occupations in which there is so much money, if the\n",
      "work is carried on in the right way. The trouble is that people often\n",
      "think it takes little intellect to be a farmer. The truth is just the\n",
      "reverse. To get returns out of the soil there must be brains in the\n",
      "skull. We know a farmer on Long Island with less than sixty acres of\n",
      "land who has acquired a fortune in fifteen years of close application to\n",
      "the problems of the farm. He has found the secret of knowing how to make\n",

      "\n",
      "711. SUBSTITUTE FOR SILK.--Send to the Department of Agriculture for\n",
      "jute seed. Jute will take dye as a sponge takes water, and it has a\n",
      "gloss which makes it capable of being used in combination with silk so\n",

      "\n",

      "712. WASHINGTON PIPPINS.--They are known as Newtown Pippins, but let us\n",
      "give you a secret. The soil of the State of Washington is so adapted to\n",
      "this apple that you can raise from one-fourth to one-half greater crops\n",
      "than in any other State. Apple raisers, remember this.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "713. DORSETS AND DOWNS.--Fancy breeds of sheep! Two hundred million\n",
      "dollars worth of wool from these breeds were imported last year. That\n",
      "was what we paid for a name, and for our ignorance in not knowing that\n",
      "we can raise just as good sheep here. Reader, if you want a share of\n",
      "this $200,000,000, study a good book about sheep farming, purchase a few\n",
      "of these two famous breeds, and put the wool on the market as the\n",
      "genuine Dorset; for so it is. The place counts for not one atom--only\n",
      "the breed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "714. AMERICAN CHEESE.--Here again we are foolishly playing into the\n",
      "hands of foreigners, paying $1,500,000 every year for that which can be\n",
      "produced equally as good and cheap at home. Everybody should know that\n",
      "there is no better spot on the globe for the kind of pasture that makes\n",
      "delicious cheese than Delaware County in the State of New York. We pay\n",
      "these millions to foreigners because we do not produce enough at home;\n",
      "but here, within two or three hours freightage of the metropolis of the\n",
      "Western World, we have the best cheese-producing country on earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "715. BUSINESS APPLES.--We call them Business Apples because they will\n",
      "mean a good business for you if you are wise enough to undertake their\n",
      "culture. Go to Missouri and try the Ben Davis variety. The soil of that\n",
      "State is the best for that kind of apple. A man there set out two\n",
      "hundred trees, and last year sold $450 worth of Ben Davis apples. At the\n",
      "same rate, one thousand trees, covering about five acres, should bring\n",
      "you $2,500.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "716. FORTUNES IN POPPIES.--Here is another new idea. France has caught\n",
      "upon it; why may not the farmer of this country? Five hundred thousand\n",
      "pounds of opium are sold every year in our drug stores, but it has been\n",
      "thought that the drug could only be raised in the East. This is a\n",
      "mistake. The French farmers sold 5,000,000 francs worth last year. It\n",
      "yields a net profit of $25 an acre and requires little culture. It may\n",
      "yet become a rival of King Cotton in our Southern States, but those who\n",
      "are wide-awake enough to be the first in the field will reap the lion’s\n",
      "share of this new bidder for our enterprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "717. THE CAPON FARM.--One hundred per cent. capons! This is the actual\n",
      "experience of a raiser. He operated on forty, sent them to market and\n",
      "realized $39.24. He estimates the cost of keeping at less than fifty\n",
      "cents each. There are few investments in which the gross proceeds are\n",
      "double the cost. In addition, the raising of capons may be carried on\n",
      "with the ordinary poultry farm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "718. BARRELS OF BALDWINS.--The home of this market favorite is Northern\n",
      "New York and Northern New England. It is a hardy tree. Apple trees\n",
      "commonly bear only every second year, and often cease to bear\n",
      "altogether. The secret of success is to stir the soil and add a little\n",
      "fertilizer. Good Baldwins, commanding from $2.50 to $3.50 per barrel,\n",
      "may be raised every year with the certainty of clockwork, if the owner\n",
      "only exercises proper diligence and care.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "719. RARE RODENTS.--Money in rats and mice! In killing them? No, in\n",
      "raising them. At the pet-stock department and appendage of the poultry\n",
      "show in New York recently, rats and mice, white or finely marked,\n",
      "brought all the way from $1 to $12, according to the fineness of the\n",
      "colors. It will be a revelation to most farmers that there is money in\n",
      "creatures which they have hitherto regarded as pests to be put out of\n",
      "the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "720. MORTGAGE-LIFTER OATS.--So-called because a man developed a\n",
      "particular variety, and with the sales, advertised as fancy seed and\n",
      "bringing more than double the ordinary kind, lifted a crushing mortgage\n",
      "from his farm. You can develop a variety as well as he. Give it a taking\n",
      "name, and advertise freely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "721. RECORD-BREAKING DATES.--A date plantation of five hundred or six\n",
      "hundred acres, and capable of holding thirty thousand trees, can be\n",
      "bought for $500. The fifth year after planting the trees should bear\n",
      "sixty thousand pounds of dates, worth at least $6,000. Pretty good\n",
      "return for $500! Dates are raised chiefly in South America.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "722. DOLLAR WHEAT.--Western farmers have contended that if they could\n",
      "command $1 a bushel for wheat they could get rich. This year their hopes\n",
      "have been realized. If it is, as many believe, the beginning of better\n",
      "times for the wheat-raiser, and the cereal can be kept at that price,\n",
      "you have but to follow the advice of Horace Greeley, and “Go West” to\n",
      "become a rich man. The government will give you the land, and industry\n",
      "and economy will do the rest.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "723. LEAF TOBACCO.--Where tobacco can be raised, farmers have abandoned\n",
      "nearly every other crop. It needs a rich, warm soil, and some experience\n",
      "in order to insure success; but if you “once learn the trade,” you will\n",
      "hardly try to raise anything else. North of Virginia, it must be raised\n",
      "it the “bottom-lands” of the rivers. Price, $8 to $10 per one hundred\n",
      "pounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "724. TREE NURSERY.--The expense of a tree nursery is almost nothing\n",
      "beyond the first investment. Small trees before transplanting may be set\n",
      "one foot apart, and hence an acre will hold about forty-four thousand.\n",
      "At nine cents apiece--the average price--this means $3,960. Deduct for\n",
      "labor and expressage. The success of the tree merchant depends almost\n",
      "solely on his finding a market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "725. ROUND NUMBER ONIONS.--The round number of one thousand bushels to\n",
      "the acre has been done, and can be done under favorable circumstances.\n",
      "In a certain district in Fairfield County, Conn., nearly all the men are\n",
      "well-to-do farmers. Ask them the secret of their success and the one\n",
      "reply will be “onions.” Here, surely, even in rocky Connecticut, farming\n",
      "pays. They get from seventy-five cents to $1.25 per bushel. The crop is\n",
      "not always a safe one, dependent upon weather conditions; but, taken one\n",
      "year with another, the farmers do well, and steadily add to their bank\n",
      "account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "726. POTATO PROFITS.--Let us see what can be done with potatoes. In a\n",
      "prize contest recently the average per acre was 465 bushels. The highest\n",
      "was 975 bushels. The price per bushel was from sixty to sixty-six cents.\n",
      "The next profit was on the average $260 per acre and in case of the\n",
      "highest was about $500. Of course this is vastly above what is\n",
      "accomplished by the ordinary farmer, but it shows what can be done with\n",
      "good soil, liberal dressing, prolific variety, and thorough tillage.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "727. GOLDEN GEESE.--Here is one man’s experience: “I bought a gander and\n",
      "three geese. From the geese I received yearly forty eggs each in two\n",
      "litters, or a total of 120. I find that from this number of eggs I can\n",
      "safely count on seventy-five per cent of matured chicks, or ninety\n",
      "goslings. The weight when fatted is 855 pounds, and at twenty cents a\n",
      "pound I receive $171. Cost of keeping is $46. Profits, $125. Of course,\n",
      "the sum varies one year from another, but this is my average for five\n",
      "years.” At the same rate the goslings from 100 geese would pay a net\n",
      "profit of $4,125, but if they paid only one-quarter that sum it would\n",
      "still be a profitable investment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "728. CALIFORNIA PRUNES.--This great state has now 85,000 acres planted\n",
      "with prunes, and produced last year 65,000,000 pounds. The crop has\n",
      "grown from nothing to this enormous amount in the last few years. People\n",
      "do not rush into an enterprise in this way unless they are pretty sure\n",
      "it is a good thing. The “good thing” in this case is that prunes costing\n",
      "one and one half cents per pound to raise sell for six and seven cents,\n",
      "and the prune raisers are all getting rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "729. A BEE FARM.--Here is another California bonanza. Says a man in the\n",
      "southern part of the State: “Last year I marketed ten tons of extracted\n",
      "honey, and three tons of comb honey, all from 154 colonies. I received\n",
      "on an average ten cents per pound, or a total of $3,600. The space\n",
      "employed was 1,386 feet, or somewhat less than an acre.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "730. THE APPLE ACRE.--A man in New England said that after forty years\n",
      "experience, raising all kinds of crops, he found that his apple orchard\n",
      "averaged $55 per acre, which was better than any crop on his other 200\n",
      "acres of land.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "731. THE SUGAR BEET.--Purchase a farm within a few miles of a sugar beet\n",
      "factory. With proper cultivation you can grow nine tons to the acre, and\n",
      "the factory price should be $4.50 per ton. The thriftiness of the beet\n",
      "makes little trouble with weeds, and hence the expense of raising is not\n",
      "one-fourth that of onions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "732. GILT-EDGED BREEDS.--The sum of $5,100 was recently paid for a\n",
      "Poland-China boar. A litter of pigs of this breed brought $3,500. These\n",
      "sums seem almost incredible, but when people have both the mania and the\n",
      "money they will pay any amount to gratify their taste. There are persons\n",
      "who take as much pride in pigs as others do in horses. The best way to\n",
      "succeed with new breeds is to cultivate a strain for yourself. It\n",
      "requires time, patience and experience, and some outlay in risk, but in\n",
      "the end it pays, especially if one has the gift of knowing how to\n",
      "trumpet his stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "733. DECEMBER LAYERS.--With a trifling expense you can have eggs at\n",
      "Christmas as well as at Easter. The price is often more than double at\n",
      "the former season. Connect with hot water-pipes and keep your hens warm.\n",
      "A cold hen never lays an egg. A poultry expert says if a flock is well\n",
      "cared for the whole year round, it should pay annually for each hen $1\n",
      "net. At the same rate a flock of four hundred would bring a net income\n",
      "of $400.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "734. FLORIDA CELERY.--In Florida the first growers made from $500 to\n",
      "$1,500 per acre. Competition has reduced the price, but at present rates\n",
      "men with six acres are getting a comfortable support, and those who have\n",
      "the means to cultivate a large farm of this popular vegetable are\n",
      "rapidly growing rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "735. ONEIDA HOPS.--It takes a good many hops to weigh a pound, but\n",
      "growers in Oneida County, New York, have raised 1,400 pounds per acre,\n",
      "receiving therefor $112. Probably this is somewhat better than the\n",
      "average, but profits in even low-price years are better in that section\n",
      "of the country than for any other crop. Hops are a safe and easy crop.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "736. BOSTON BEANS.--They are not raised in Boston--only baked there.\n",
      "They are a hardy crop, and will grow on any properly cultivated soil.\n",
      "One year with another they bring $2.50 per bushel. Beans are the surest\n",
      "of all crops, and if the price were only as certain, you could figure\n",
      "out your income in advance almost as accurately as if employed on a\n",
      "salary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "737. CHRISTMAS TREES.--Buy for a few hundred dollars an abandoned farm\n",
      "too poor for culture, and pack it with small evergreens. Christmas trees\n",
      "command from fifty cents to $5, and you can grow a thousand of them on a\n",
      "single acre. There are fortunes in what is called worthless land if you\n",
      "know how to improve it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "738. THE GUARANTEED EGG.--A great business can be done with a guaranteed\n",
      "egg. Success depends upon the absolute perfection of your egg. Have a\n",
      "stamp made, and stamp every egg with the name of your farm, and offer to\n",
      "replace any one found faulty. Also stamp the date on which they are\n",
      "taken from the nest. In this way you will absolutely protect your\n",
      "product from the frauds of dealers, your eggs will attain a wide\n",
      "reputation, will have an unlimited demand, and you will grow rich. There\n",
      "is a mine of gold in this suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "739. DOUBLE VEGETABLE CULTURE.--Here is an idea of a New Jersey farmer.\n",
      "He has conceived the notion of grafting tomatoes on potatoes vines, or\n",
      "an air crop on a root crop, and thus raising vegetables at both ends.\n",
      "There is nothing impracticable in the notion, and it is doubtless\n",
      "entirely feasible, if only he is liberal enough with his fertilizers.\n",
      "This is an idea for growers who have only a limited space, and where\n",
      "land is high.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "740. ENGLISH SHIRES.--Colts from Lord Rothschild’s stud farm last year\n",
      "averaged $875. It costs little more to keep a good horse than a poor\n",
      "one. There are great possibilities in the raising of fine-blooded\n",
      "horses. The colt that won the great Futurity race this year could have\n",
      "been easily bought for $700 before the race. Now $20,000 will not\n",
      "purchase him. “Plunger” Walton made $350,000 in two years on the turf.\n",
      "At the Elmendorf stud farm near Lexington, Ky., a short time ago\n",
      "thirty-three yearling colts were sold at prices ranging from $150 to\n",
      "$5,100, the average price being $1,460.87 per head; at the same time\n",
      "twenty yearling fillies brought an average of $676.50 per head, the\n",
      "forty-three yearling colts and fillies being the product of one breeding\n",
      "farm and selling in one day for $47,130 or an average of $1,095.80 per\n",
      "head.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "741. FORTUNES IN NUT SHELLS.--Land too poor for meadow or even for\n",
      "pasture may be utilized for nut-growing. The trees require little\n",
      "attention, but will produce bushels of nuts if the soil is properly\n",
      "stirred and fertilized every year. One man in Connecticut raises each\n",
      "year 100 bushels of hickory nuts from ten trees, and sells them at $2 a\n",
      "bushel. The rocky, waste lands of New England can grow millions of these\n",
      "trees. Chestnuts can be grown cheaper than wheat. The standard price is\n",
      "$4 to $8 per bushel, but large chestnuts, early in the season, that is,\n",
      "in September and October, bring from $10 to $15 per bushel. Judge Salt,\n",
      "of Burlington, N. J., says he has a chestnut tree in the middle of a\n",
      "wheat field that pays more than the wheat. The average is about $19 per\n",
      "tree, and twenty trees have ample room in an acre. This makes $300 per\n",
      "acre with but little cost for cultivation. Here is something of\n",
      "importance about the pecan. The chief pomologist at Washington, D. C.,\n",
      "says: “The cultivation of nuts will soon be one of the greatest and most\n",
      "profitable industries in the United States, and there is no use in\n",
      "denying the fact that the Texas soft shell pecan is the favorite nut of\n",
      "the world.” The average yield of these nuts in North Carolina is $300 to\n",
      "$500 per acre. Some pecan trees in New Jersey are producing annually\n",
      "five to six bushels of delicious, thin-shelled nuts.\n",

      "fame, but fame and fortune are twin sisters which are seldom separated.\n",
      "Hack writers are indeed hard worked and poorly paid, but in the higher\n",
      "walks of literature rewards are generous. In London, the rates to\n",
      "first-class writers are $100 per 1,000 words. In one case $135 was paid,\n",
      "and in another $175 demanded. Amelia Barr, the famous novelist, receives\n",
      "$20,000 a year from the sale of her books. There is a great deal of\n",
      "subterranean literature unknown to the critics and the magazine writers,\n",
      "but which, nevertheless, pays handsomely. One Richebourg, of Paris, has\n",
      "4,000,000 readers, and often receives $12,000 for the serial rights\n",
      "alone, yet he is unknown to the magazine public. In this country the\n",
      "“Albatross Novels,” by Albert Ross, sold to the extent of a million\n",
      "copies, and the author acquired such a fortune that he was able to\n",
      "engage in charity on a magnificent scale, yet the author is unknown to\n",
      "fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among the instances of the pecuniary rewards for single works are “Les\n",
      "Miserables,” by Victor Hugo, which brought $80,000 and “Trilby,” which\n",
      "netted the author the princely sum of $400,000. “Quo Vadis,” by\n",
      "Sienkiewicz, sells all over the world, but its author had already made\n",
      "half a million dollars with his pen before he wrote that popular book.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not our purpose in this chapter to treat of books requiring\n",
      "transcendent genius to create, but rather to suggest titles of works\n",
      "which may be composed by less gifted authors, books, which if written\n",
      "with fair ability cannot fail to be of interest and profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "742. THE POPULAR NOVEL.--This is the best paying form of literature. The\n",
      "pen that can touch the popular heart may not be a gold one, but it will\n",
      "bring gold into the pockets of him who wields it. Amelie Rives received\n",
      "$6,000 for “According to St. John.” Lord Lytton received $7,500 for some\n",
      "of his novels. Of the “Heavenly Twins,” 50,000 copies were sold in 1894;\n",
      "of the “Bonny Brier Bush,” 30,000 in five months; and of the “Manxman”\n",
      "50,000 in four months. Of Mrs. Henry Wood’s “East Lynne,” 400,000 have\n",
      "been sold, and her thirty-four books have reached altogether over\n",
      "1,000,000 copies. In France, there are sold every year of Feuilleton’s\n",
      "works, 50,000; of Daudet’s, 80,000, and of Zola’s, 90,000. Hall Caine\n",
      "received outright a check for $50,000 for “The Christian.” He had struck\n",
      "the popular chord with the “Deemster.” There was almost a pilgrimage of\n",
      "publishers to the Isle of Man to make engagements for the pen of the new\n",
      "writer when that book was launched upon the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "743. THE SHORT STORY.--The short story is very popular in this country,\n",
      "and has attained a perfection reached nowhere else in the world. The\n",
      "rules of success in this department are briefly these: First, to be\n",
      "strikingly original; second, to write simply and naturally; and third,\n",
      "to condense into the smallest compass. Be brief. This is the age of\n",
      "electricity. Many a story of 10,000 words has been rejected when if it\n",
      "had contained half that number it would have been accepted. Publishers\n",
      "pay liberal rates for short, good stories. The New York _Herald_\n",
      "recently paid Mollie E. Seawell $3,000 for a short story. Within a very\n",
      "short time a magazine has offered a price of $1,000 for the best short\n",
      "story; another has made the same offer; and a third one of $500. Among\n",
      "the publications that pay the authors the highest rates are _Harper’s\n",
      "Magazine_, the _Century_, _McClure’s_, the _Youth’s Companion_, and the\n",
      "_Ladies’ Home Journal_. There are several others that pay nearly as\n",
      "much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "744. THE VILLAGE REPORTER.--Write up some event that occurs in your\n",
      "neighborhood. Any leading newspaper will pay for it if well written. It\n",
      "must be spicy, but not ornate. Put in strong, nervous adjectives; color\n",
      "well. Take care not to make it libelous. If you succeed you can try\n",
      "again, and if you show aptness at the work you will doubtless secure a\n",
      "position as a reporter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "745. THE TRUTH CONDENSER.--Facts for the million! Do you know that a\n",
      "cyclopedia of the most useful information can be written in a single\n",
      "volume? The “Britannica” has twenty-five volumes. The “International”\n",
      "fifteen. Here is needed the faculty of condensation. Use facts only, and\n",
      "you will be surprised to find how many articles consist only of words.\n",
      "Make use of the great cyclopedias, the newspaper almanacs, government\n",
      "reports, and all books in which knowledge is condensed. Pack the book\n",
      "full of the things the millions want to know.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "746. TOWN HISTORY.--Write a short history of your native town or of some\n",
      "other town. Publish the portraits, and residences or places of business,\n",
      "of the leading townsmen. Mention in the book everybody in the town whom\n",
      "you can. Even for the most humble can be found a place in a work of\n",
      "genealogy. The wealthy will give you large sums for the illustrations,\n",
      "and the vanity of the poor will cause them to buy a book in which their\n",
      "name appears. Cost of issue of book, $1,000. One thousand subscribers at\n",
      "$2 apiece, $2,000. One hundred of the wealthier class who will pay you\n",
      "$10 apiece for their portraits, $1,000. Profits, $2,000. If you are\n",
      "satisfied with the result, go on to the next town, and so on _ad\n",
      "infinitum_.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "747. THE SHOPPERS’ GUIDE.--A small book could be issued in paper covers\n",
      "for twenty-five cents, giving an explanation of every kind of goods, the\n",
      "difference, and the best kinds and brands. Not one person in twenty is\n",
      "posted on these things, and must take the clerk’s word. It should show\n",
      "what firms make a specialty in any line or department, and on what days\n",
      "they make a discount. Merchants would no doubt pay you at advertising\n",
      "rates for such a notice of their places of business. The book should\n",
      "include dry-goods and fancy stores as well as grocers and meat markets.\n",
      "Such a book should sell by the million.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "748. A BIRTHDAY BOOK.--We have the “Shakespeare Birthday Book,” the\n",
      "“Tennyson Birthday Book,” the “Emerson Birthday Book,” and many others.\n",
      "Add one more, the “Richter.” The writings of Jean Paul abound in\n",
      "felicitous and eloquent passages, just suited for such a work.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "749. A CHURCH-WORKERS’ BOOK.--A man had a half-written book on\n",
      "church-work, dividing it into twenty branches with one thousand working\n",
      "plans to be given by the most successful ministers and other Christian\n",
      "workers in the land; but owing to a pressure of other duties he was\n",
      "unable to complete it. This lead is still unworked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "750. HOUSEHOLD ECONOMICS.--A book can be written by one who understands\n",
      "the subject which it would pay every housekeeper to buy. The kitchen\n",
      "alone should supply at least one hundred examples of waste. The care of\n",
      "servants would employ another important part of the book. Every room\n",
      "would afford a chapter. Such a book, telling the inexperienced\n",
      "housekeeper what to buy and how to economize would save money for many a\n",
      "beginner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "751. THE PLAIN MAN’S MEAL.--A book with this title should have a ready\n",
      "sale. All cook books are for persons who can keep a butler, or at least\n",
      "one or two servants. The recipes are expensive. Write one by means of\n",
      "which an economical housewife can get a meal for four at an expense of\n",
      "fifty cents. A regular _menu_ for each meal for every day of the year\n",
      "would be appreciated. Plain food and simple cooking at cheap cost. The\n",
      "book should not be over 300 pages, and should not sell for more than one\n",
      "dollar.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "752. PRESENT CENTURY CELEBRITIES.--Nothing in history is harder to find\n",
      "out than the lives of persons in the last generation. History tells us\n",
      "the remote past, contemporary literature tells us about the present, but\n",
      "there is no book that tells us about the recent past. The men who were\n",
      "prominent in statesmanship, commerce and literature, two or three\n",
      "decades ago are not heard of now. A new generation has come upon the\n",
      "stage and knows them not. This is a want felt by every one who takes the\n",
      "slightest interest in times and men. Get out a book with a short chapter\n",
      "devoted to each of the prominent men who have lived in the last half of\n",
      "the nineteenth century. If this work seems too voluminous, then let it\n",
      "comprise only the leading men in our country since the Civil War. If\n",
      "well written it should command a great sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "753. READERS’ GUIDE BOOK.--A guide book for good reading which can be\n",
      "sold for $1 is a desideratum. Enumerate a few of the best books of all\n",
      "the great departments of literature with a short critique upon each. The\n",
      "list of the books as well as the critiques can be condensed from any of\n",
      "the ponderous reference lists in our great libraries.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "754. AMERICAN ELOQUENCE.--There should be a book published which would\n",
      "preserve the different types of American eloquence. If it could be made\n",
      "a kind of text-book on oratory, it would have an immense sale. Tens of\n",
      "thousands of young men are fitting themselves to be lawyers, preachers,\n",
      "elocutionists, and public speakers in various capacities. They want a\n",
      "book which will give them the rules and models of effective speech. A\n",
      "book written with so much care as to make it a kind of standard of\n",
      "eloquence and oratory would pay well for the painstaking task. Our\n",
      "standard schoolbooks have proved mints of money to their authors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "755. RACERS’ RECORD BOOK.--A book which should be a reliable record of\n",
      "the fastest times made in horse races, bicycle meets, and sporting\n",
      "matches, ought to have a ready sale. It should consist of condensed\n",
      "tables of all the records of all the great races, interspaced with blank\n",
      "leaves for the jotting down of new records. There are at least a million\n",
      "men interested in racing, and at a very moderate estimate one-quarter\n",
      "(250,000) ought to buy your book, which, we will say, sells for\n",
      "twenty-five cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "756. YOUR OWN PHYSICIAN.--We want a book on health, written from the\n",
      "latest point of view of hygiene and physiology. Get a symposium of\n",
      "physicians to write on such topics as dress, diet, exercise, sleep,\n",
      "medicine, baths, etc. Most physicians would regard the advertising\n",
      "benefits of these articles as sufficient remuneration, while at the same\n",
      "time their names would help to sell the work, but if necessary pay them\n",
      "for their services. Entitle the work, “Your Own Physician,” and sell it\n",
      "on subscription, the canvasser showing how much cheaper it is to keep\n",
      "well at $2--the price of the book--than to get well at $200--the charge\n",
      "of a physician for services in a long spell of illness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "757. THE BOY’S ASTRONOMY.--A small book about the sun, moon and stars,\n",
      "made attractive for beginners. It should teem with illustrations, and\n",
      "the youthful reader should be fascinated as he follows the sun and moon\n",
      "in their courses, learns how eclipses occur, and understands about\n",
      "meteors, comets, and nebulæ. There should also be directions for\n",
      "finding the principal stars on any night of the year. Such a book should\n",
      "command a ready sale, for he who writes for boys and girls has the\n",
      "largest market.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "758. RECREATIONS IN CHEMISTRY.--A bishop of the Methodist Episcopal\n",
      "Church once wrote a book entitled “Recreations in Astronomy,” which has\n",
      "had a very large sale. But there is just as much room for “Recreations\n",
      "in Chemistry,” if written with as much imagination and skill. It should\n",
      "contain such fascinating chapters as “Chemistry of a Candle,” “The\n",
      "Dynamics of a Dewdrop,” “The Evolution of an Oak.” The chief points in\n",
      "the authorship should be accuracy and a charming style.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "759. THE CURIOSITY BOOK.--A book packed with the curious things in every\n",
      "department of human research. People like to read about the rare and the\n",
      "curious. A hundred chapters, short, spicy, and containing each a few\n",
      "wonderful things in a special field of learning, would be very popular\n",
      "with both young and old. As a gift book it would be unexcelled. There is\n",
      "money in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "760. THE CHILD’S BIBLE.--A Bible which shall contain the numerous\n",
      "stories so connected in narrative form as to make a continuous history\n",
      "from beginning to end. It should be very simple, and in no way do\n",
      "violence to the sacred record. If properly written, this book could be\n",
      "sold by canvassers in almost every home, and should bring much gain to\n",
      "the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "761. GUIDE TO TRADES.--A complete guide to all the important\n",
      "professions, occupations, callings and trades. This work should show\n",
      "the opportunities in each trade, the comparative chances of success, the\n",
      "remuneration, and a few simple rules for guidance. It should bristle\n",
      "with facts, and should also give one or two examples in the form of\n",
      "stories--short autobiographies still better--of men who have been\n",
      "successful in each department of work. The advantage of this book is\n",
      "that it has no competitor, covering an entirely new field in authorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "762. THE PLEASURE BOOK.--Here is a unique idea for a book. Let there be\n",
      "three hundred or more sections, one for every week day in the year, and\n",
      "let each section contain a different form of amusement. Books on games,\n",
      "riddles, sports, etc., can be drawn upon for supplies. As you must\n",
      "provide enjoyment for all kinds of weather, it will be well to have a\n",
      "short alternative for rainy days in each section. The amusement should\n",
      "be of the greatest possible variety, from the fox-hunt in the fields to\n",
      "the thimble-hunt in the parlor. As a large number of people have leisure\n",
      "only at night, perhaps a work entitled, “Three Hundred Happy Evenings”\n",
      "would be better than the suggestion above, though it would necessarily\n",
      "have to leave out most outdoor sports. Holidays should have a more\n",
      "elaborate programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "763. THE SOLDIER’S BOOK.--There are 750,000 survivors of our Civil War.\n",
      "It would be too much to publish in one book even the briefest account of\n",
      "each. The work should be published in several parts, a volume to a\n",
      "State. In a State like New York, three lines only could be given to the\n",
      "record of a private, but even for the briefest mention of himself and\n",
      "his comrades nearly all the old soldiers would buy the book. In smaller\n",
      "States more space could be given to each man’s record. Considerable\n",
      "capital would be required in the collecting of facts and records, but\n",
      "the publication of such a work would certainly pay, if accurately\n",
      "written and thoroughly canvassed. We have estimated the cost of\n",
      "collecting the information at twenty-five cents for each soldier. It\n",
      "would be much less in great cities where a large number of men could be\n",
      "seen in one day. Cost for 100,000 soldiers, $25,000. Such is the vanity\n",
      "caused by seeing one’s name in print that the book would sell at least\n",
      "to every second soldier. Fifty thousand copies at $2.50, $125,000.\n",
      "Deduct one-fourth for cost and getting out the book, $31,250. Discount\n",
      "for canvassers at one-third the price of the book, $41,666. Total cost,\n",
      "$72,916. Profits, $51,084 for 50,000 copies.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "764. BOOK OF STYLE.--A man well versed in books could write a small\n",
      "volume on literary style which could be sold to advantage for $1 per\n",
      "copy. The number of literary men is constantly increasing. More than\n",
      "10,000 young men and women are graduated every year from our colleges.\n",
      "At a very low estimate, 25,000 would want a work of this kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "765. SCIENCE OF COMMON THINGS.--A book of great interest to everybody\n",
      "could be compiled from the vast body of matter contained in the last\n",
      "quarter of a century in such periodicals as the _Popular Science\n",
      "Monthly_, the _Scientific American_, etc. It should contain a number of\n",
      "chapters about the heating and ventilating of dwellings, about clothing\n",
      "and food, about road making and house building, and many other things,\n",
      "and be written in such a fascinating style as to make the work\n",
      "attractive, even to persons who ordinarily take no interest in such\n",
      "discussions. The success of such a book depends entirely upon its style.\n",
      "It is possible to write one containing a fortune for the author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "766. POPULAR SONGS.--If you are a musical composer there is another rich\n",
      "field which invites you. Many a man in the making of bars and clefs has\n",
      "braided strands of gold. Daniel Emmett wrote “Dixie,” and it ran like\n",
      "wild fire all over the country. Stephen Foster made a fortune with “Old\n",
      "Folks at Home,” Charles K. Harris wrote “After the Ball.” Its sales were\n",
      "over a million copies, and it made him an independently rich man. H. W.\n",
      "Petrie wrote “I Don’t Want to Play in Your Yard.” Its success was\n",
      "phenomenal, and is likely to prove a bonanza to the author; 50,000\n",
      "copies were sold before they were fairly dry from the press. Edward B.\n",
      "Marks, a young writer of New York, wrote “The Little Lost Child,” which\n",
      "netted him $15,000. Sir Arthur Sullivan received $50,000 for his famous\n",
      "song, “The Lost Chord.” Mr. Balfe got $40,000 for “I Dreamt that I Dwelt\n",
      "in Marble Halls.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "767. FOREIGN TRANSLATIONS.--Another very wide field is that of the\n",
      "translation of foreign works. There are vast numbers of foreign works\n",
      "upon which there are no copyrights in this country, and others upon\n",
      "which the copyrights have expired. This is a profitable field and\n",
      "comparatively unworked. Even of such transcendant works as those of\n",
      "George Sand and Balzac only a few have been translated. Publishers pay\n",
      "for translations about the same as royalties on original works. Dryden\n",
      "received $6,000 for his translation of Virgil, and Pope received $40,000\n",
      "for his rendering of the “Iliad.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "768. CHILDREN’S STORIES.--There are bags of money in children’s stories.\n",
      "Every child at a certain age wants to read or be read to, and there are\n",
      "seven million of this age in the United States. The stories should be\n",
      "short, bright, simple and original, and the book should contain a number\n",
      "of illustrations. Whoever pleases the children pleases the world. “Alice\n",
      "in Wonderland” brought a fortune to its author, and every year Christmas\n",
      "stories for the children bring much money into the pockets of the\n",
      "writers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "769. CONDENSED STORIES.--All the popular and standard fiction of the\n",
      "world could be condensed into a dozen volumes by a master hand. It has\n",
      "never yet been attempted. Some omnivorous reader and ambitious writer\n",
      "may yet try it. He must get the heart of the story--the plot--without\n",
      "regard to side issues, by-plays, or ornamentation. See in how few words\n",
      "you can tell one of the Waverley novels without omitting any of the main\n",
      "features. Then publish the entire series in one volume. It is a new\n",
      "idea, and ought to take.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "770. THE MANNER BOOK.--How to Act, How to Behave, How to Eat, How to\n",
      "Talk, How to Write Letters, How to Propose--in short, the correct way to\n",
      "get on in life. A book consisting of pert, witty chapters upon good\n",
      "manners ought to make a fast-selling work. Many have been written, but\n",
      "none as yet quite meet the demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "771. THE GEORGE REPUBLIC.--Something entirely new. Do you know that in\n",
      "the village of Freeville, Tompkins County, New York, there is a republic\n",
      "composed of many hundred persons ruled entirely by boys, and these the\n",
      "worst of boys, taken mostly from the slums of our cities, a class which\n",
      "could not be governed in the ordinary way? It is hardly too much to say\n",
      "that it is the most suggestive experiment in self-government in all\n",
      "history, and it awaits the pen of a practiced writer. The movement is\n",

      "772. ONE THOUSAND TIMES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC.--Here is a capital idea!\n",
      "Many sea captains have crossed the ocean as many times as that. Get an\n",
      "Atlantic veteran to tell you some of the most thrilling stories of his\n",
      "forty years’ sailing. He may not be much of a writer, but you can put\n",
      "the matter into attractive form. For a small compensation, or perhaps\n",
      "for the love of the thing, he would tell you many exciting tales of the\n",
      "sea. The title is taking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "773. THE MAN HUNTER.--Few writings are more fascinating than detective\n",
      "stories, and no one has more interesting matter to relate than one of\n",
      "the sleuths of the law. Think of “Sherlock Holmes,” whom Conan Doyle\n",
      "created, and who has made piles of money for his author.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "774. STORY OF A RAGPICKER.--It is a new idea. Did a ragpicker ever write\n",
      "before? But he must have had many interesting experiences. Transfer the\n",
      "stories from his tongue to your pen. Paste these uncouth patches into a\n",
      "literary crazy-quilt as an experienced writer knows how to do, and you\n",
      "will have a book whose title will advertise it, and whose unique\n",
      "contents will make it sell.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "775. STORY OF A DIVER.--Under the ocean! Jules Verne’s “Twenty Thousand\n",
      "Leagues Under the Sea” actualized! No one can have more thrilling\n",
      "experiences than a diver. Catch the homely words from his lips, gild\n",
      "them with a lively imagination, color them with an expert pen, and you\n",
      "have a book whose sales will astonish you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "776. STORY OF A CONVICT.--Here is another new idea. The under side of\n",
      "life is seldom if ever told. Who knows what the convict thinks, feels,\n",
      "and suffers? Let a narrative be written from a convict’s point of view.\n",
      "Let him tell how he committed the crime, how he was induced to do it,\n",
      "how he felt when he was doing it, his motives and hopes, the account of\n",
      "his arrest, what his lawyer said to him, his trial, condemnation, and\n",
      "sentence. Then his long imprisonment. A convict who is a good talker\n",
      "could easily give you material which you could skillfully work up into\n",
      "an attractive book, as novel as it would be interesting. Much of the\n",
      "success of “Les Miserables” was due to the vivid portrayal of the\n",
      "sufferings of Jean Valjean.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "777. THE STOWAWAY.--Another unique idea! Stowaways are constantly\n",
      "crossing the ocean. Get his story. Tell pathetically his motives for\n",
      "crossing the water, and the account of his privations on shipboard. Here\n",
      "is matter for another Robinson Crusoe.\n",

      "or thirty of them in his own way, the thrilling adventures, the\n",
      "hairbreadth escapes, the heroic rescues, and the magnificent and\n",

      "\n",
      "780. IN A BALLOON.--Here is a most attractive field which has never been\n",

      "only a phantasy, while we may have an equally interesting reality--not\n",
      "indeed of a journey to the moon, but through the clouds. If the\n",
      "narrative could be combined with a romance, this might be made the book\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "781. STORY OF AN ENGINEER.--Another man whose life is worth relating is\n",
      "that of an old engineer. Fill the book with an account of his wonderful\n",
      "runs and his thrilling adventures on frontier roads. Of course, there\n",
      "must be horrible accidents, daring “hold-ups,” bold train robberies,\n",

      "out of hundreds of convicts you should be able to weave a tale as lurid\n",
      "as Blackbeard among the pirates or Bluebeard among the fairies. If it be\n",

      "the manner of C. Brockden Brown’s “Weiland,” could be worked up from the\n",

      "Niagara the greatest cataract, Monte Carlo the greatest gambling place,\n",
      "while other chapters would be headed, “The Greatest Picture Gallery,”\n",

      "principal in all parts of the country, and write charmingly of their\n",
      "peculiar merits. Especially impress upon your public the specific\n",

      "It would be very popular if you could secure as authors such men as John\n",

      "to strangers who want to see the great metropolis. It should contain at\n",
      "least three sets of directions for persons preparing to visit the city\n",
      "for the first time. These methods and order of sightseeing should be\n",
      "radically different, giving the intending visitor the choice of the\n",

      "\n",
      "794. MAP MAKING.--There is money in the making of town, county and state\n",
      "maps. For this you need the services of a good surveyor. Go to a map\n",
      "publisher and get his estimates of cost; he can inform you where to get\n",
      "a surveyor, and give you much other valuable advice. As a rule, maps\n",
      "sell in proportion to the smallness of the territory portrayed, people\n",
      "being chiefly interested in their immediate neighborhood. It is with\n",
      "towns as with boarders--there is not much money in one or two, but he\n",

      "Gould got his first start in this way.\n",
      "\n",

      "795. STORY OF THE POLE.--A score or more of great captains have tried to\n",
      "reach the pole, and many of them have told their story in captivating\n",
      "books, but we want a book in which each man’s story shall be condensed\n",
      "into a single chapter of fifty pages each. The thousands of people who\n",
      "like comparisons and admire hardy adventures would like a book of this\n",
      "kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "796. THE MAKING OF A MIGHTY BUSINESS.--We have spoken of the men who\n",
      "made the business, but this book deals with the business itself. What a\n",
      "great book could be made of a few chapters each, one devoted to such\n",
      "themes as “A Great Railroad,” “A Great Sugar House,” “A Great Banking\n",
      "House,” “A Great Steamship Company,” “The New York Post Office,” “The\n",
      "United States Patent Office.” This book would appeal for interest to all\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "797. HEROES OF LABOR.--Now let the laboring man tell his story. A book\n",
      "to consist of chapters written by such labor leaders as T. V. Powderly,\n",
      "Samuel Gompers, Mr. Sovereign, and other Knights of Labor, relating the\n",
      "story of their struggles with capital. Technical matters, such as\n",
      "interviews with directors and tables of wages should be made as brief as\n",
      "possible, while strikes, scenes of violence and suffering, should form\n",
      "the chief matter of the book. Here is a chance for a gifted writer to\n",
      "make a second “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” a book whose sale in this country has\n",
      "eclipsed that of any other thing ever published.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "798. THE ELITE DIRECTORY.--Some cities like New York have such a book,\n",
      "but other cities have not. Here is a field for the talent of the\n",
      "reportorial variety. It will be a delicate matter to decide who shall be\n",
      "included in the gilded circle and who shall be excluded, but if you are\n",
      "discreet and discriminating, careful to make your book contain the names\n",
      "of only the recognized people of society, these will in nearly all cases\n",
      "buy your book, and will not be afraid of a good round price.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "799. POPULAR DRAMAS.--These have made the fortunes of their authors. A\n",
      "playwright often receives $100 per night while the play runs. More\n",
      "frequently the manager pays a sum outright for the rights of the play.\n",
      "The sum of $10,000 was paid recently for the right to dramatize a\n",
      "popular work of fiction, the author having already received a fortune\n",
      "from its sale as a novel. Eugene Scribe, the French dramatist, left at\n",
      "his death the sum of $800,000, mainly his earnings as a playwright.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "800. FURNISHING A HOME.--A book on home furnishing, treating the subject\n",
      "from an artistic point of view, would doubtless find a market. Each room\n",
      "should have a separate chapter. The furnishing should be considered from\n",
      "the standpoint of expense, comfort, color and harmony. A book entitled\n",
      "“Inside a Hundred Homes” had a large sale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "801. PRETTY WEDDINGS.--Here is a field entirely unoccupied. Select\n",
      "twenty of the most stylish weddings of modern times, and give a full\n",
      "account of them. They should be, of course, weddings among the bon ton.\n",
      "The book would be a kind of fashionable wedding guide, and would be\n",
      "eagerly bought by every lady who expects to be a bride. The book also\n",
      "might contain hints and rules for weddings among all grades of social\n",
      "life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "802. QUOTATION BOOK.--One not classified in the old way, according to\n",
      "subjects, but in relation to occasion. Quotations for the business mart,\n",
      "the theatre, the church, the political arena, the dinner party, etc. If\n",
      "made to be sold very cheap it would have a good sale; or it might be\n",
      "combined at a higher price with a book on manners. See No. 770.\n",

      "newspaper success. He is sure that the majority of these plans are\n",
      "absolutely new and perfectly feasible, but the scope of the work will\n",

      "their news served hot. We want to swallow the day’s doings while we\n",
      "cross the ferry. Have an index on first page containing every item of\n",
      "news, and showing in what columns it can be found. Then, one can get the\n",

      "news the quickest and neatest is going to the front. Some people care\n",
      "more for quantity than quality. A vast variety of news from all parts of\n",
      "the country, and each item condensed into a few lines, makes more\n",
      "impression on many people than a page devoted to a single tragedy. The\n",

      "805. THE BULLETIN FORECAST.--Most daily papers give out a bulletin.\n",
      "Thousands stand on the street and read the free bulletin, but do not buy\n",
      "the paper. Have a forecast bulletin to read, “To-morrow’s News.” Then a\n",

      "sensational and interesting way. Thus: “The _Bugle_ will tell you all\n",

      "embellishments. It is well known that in many papers reporters are\n",
      "allowed to invent when they have no facts in the case, and as they are\n",
      "paid by the piece it is for their interest to make as much of an item as\n",
      "they can. Hence, our news is adulterated, distorted, and often\n",
      "falsified. We know some reporters who have invented columns of so-called\n",
      "“Facts;” others who have made sensational, highly-colored stories out of\n",
      "the most insignificant occurrences; and still others who have invented\n",
      "fake reports of sermons, lectures, and other public utterances, when\n",
      "they had not time to obtain the originals. Have it clearly understood in\n",
      "large headlines as a part of the policy of the paper that no reporter\n",
      "will be allowed to invent or exaggerate, that he will be instantly\n",
      "discharged if it can be shown that he has in any way distorted the cold\n",
      "facts. In this way tens of thousands who are now disgusted with what is\n",
      "dished up for them as news but know not where to turn for better\n",

      "class, or corporation. Announce that you will publish letters from\n",
      "anybody, regardless of grammar, sentiment, or position, with the only\n",
      "limitation of decency and personality. Advocate persistently cheap and\n",
      "honest public service. Let one of your mottoes be: “A penny a letter and\n",
      "a penny a mile,” that is, the conviction that a letter ought to be sent\n",

      "into this country from China. It was reported to yield three crops a\n",
      "year, a total of 1,500 pounds to the acre, and that the fiber would\n",
      "produce a cloth equal to cotton or even silk. Great things were\n",
      "anticipated, but the hopes of the raisers were defeated by the lack of a\n",
      "process for separating it into fine filaments. The slow hand press of\n",

      "States and England depend for their livelihood on the cotton trade.\n",
      "Until recently New England had a monopoly of the cotton manufacture in\n",

      "the cheaper cost of iron and fuel, the business can be carried on more\n",
      "advantageously in the South. The coal and iron in the mountains and the\n",
      "proximity to the raw product will cause New England soon to be distanced\n",
      "in this important enterprise. For those who seek cotton manufacture for\n",
      "a livelihood or for a competence, and especially for those who are\n",
      "beginning the business, the northern parts of Georgia and Alabama\n",
      "present unrivaled opportunities for the carrying on of that industry;\n",

      "real article can name his own price. Four processes have recently been\n",
      "patented, but the results are a fiber too coarse, too stiff, too weak,\n",

      "$1.23 a pound, and it sells at $2.70 a pound, a very good profit if only\n",

      "Meanwhile, there is money in the following fertilizers:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "821. GARBAGE.--Every truck load of garbage is worth at least a dollar\n",
      "for manuring purposes, and yet thousands of these loads are dumped every\n",
      "day into the water. Instead of the city paying a round sum for the\n",

      "one half to his compost heap, and thus double his sale of fertilizers.\n",
      "\n",

      "823. URBAN SEWAGE.--The best of all fertilizers is allowed to float out\n",
      "to sea and is lost. The Germans are wiser. They utilize all these waste\n",
      "products, and the surprising fertility of the soil near Berlin is the\n",
      "result of this wise employment of nature’s richest fertilizer. There are\n",

      "large cities of this country.\n",

      "Fertilizer Company would pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "825. PHOSPHATES.--The phosphate rocks of North Carolina, South Carolina,\n",
      "and Georgia contain fortunes for the men who will develop those\n",
      "industries. The quantity is practically unlimited, and the price of\n",
      "phosphate is $18 a ton. Cheap freights will make these rocks mines of\n",
      "wealth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "826. COTTONSEED MEAL.--This sells for $20 to $25 a ton, and being a\n",

      "among the farmers if they knew its value.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "827. CITY STABLES.--Much of the product of city stables is carried to\n",
      "the country in barges and sold, but more is wasted; especially is this\n",
      "the case with single and small stables in the suburbs, where the\n",
      "accumulation is light, and the law does not require its removal. But a\n",
      "systematic collection of these products would pay any one who should\n",
      "undertake it on a large scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "828. PEAT.--New Jersey has more than 1,000 square miles of peat lands,\n",
      "for the most part undeveloped. The peat is from three to six feet in\n",
      "depth. When phosphates are selling for $18 a ton, there ought to be a\n",
      "market for peat at $5, which would still leave a good margin of profit,\n",
      "if, as seems entirely reasonable, the labor and freightage could be\n",
      "covered for $3.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "829. MENHADEN.--The farmers of the eastern end of Long Island have found\n",
      "this an excellent fertilizer. The fish are strewn whole upon the land.\n",
      "More than 1,000,000 of the tiny creatures, or upward of 100 tons, have\n",
      "been caught by one vessel in a single day. The industry is chiefly\n",

      "profitable along other parts of the coast.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "soot produced in London twenty years ago was 1,100,810 bushels, and is\n",
      "probably about the same for New York to-day. The average price was five\n",
      "cents a bushel, and the total worth $109,165. Probably in this\n",
      "country--at least until its worth is discovered--it could in most cases\n",

      "railroad companies, and in fact all persons doing business on a large\n",

      "suggested:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "832. MONEY AND THE MUSE.--Select some liberal advertiser and note what\n",
      "he has to sell or what he has to do, and embody his peculiar merit in a\n",
      "poem. The poem should be short, spicy and humorous, and not be more than\n",
      "eight or ten lines in length. Let it hit off some of the fads of the\n",
      "day. If it be headed by some catch-word of the hour, so much the better.\n",
      "An ingenious person who can write a verse or two of this kind will find\n",
      "a ready market for his muse.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "833. CENTS IN NONSENSE.--If you have artistic talent instead of poetic,\n",
      "you can do still better with a drawing. Let the cut be as original and\n",
      "humorous as some of the cartoons in our daily papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "834. WORD PUZZLE.--A puzzle to some minds will be still more effective.\n",
      "Many will be disinclined to use their brains to work it out, but those\n",
      "who do will remember it, and that after all is the merit of an\n",
      "advertisement. A puzzle which may be patented and sold to the advertiser\n",
      "promises much greater profit. See the “Chinese-Get-Off-the-Earth\n",
      "Puzzle.” A puzzle of this kind is commonly sold exclusively to one firm,\n",
      "and ought to bring quite a sum of money to the inventor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "835. TRACKS TO WEALTH.--The inventor who can produce a scheme to cause\n",
      "the customer to become his unconscious advertiser has found the very\n",
      "highroad to success. Such a scheme might be a word in raised letters on\n",
      "the heel of a shoe. Thousands, especially in country towns where there\n",
      "are no sidewalks, would constantly be leaving impressions in the mud,\n",
      "and people would be astonished to find advertisements stamped on the\n",
      "very earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "836. THE STORY ADVERTISEMENT.--Write a short story which ends in an\n",
      "advertisement. This is one of the best methods to gain the reader’s eye.\n",
      "Everybody likes a story, and will read it if it be short. The narrative\n",
      "should lead up gradually and naturally to the advertisement. This\n",
      "requires some ingenuity and skill in writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "837. THE FICTITIOUS BANK BILL.--A piece of paper which at first sight\n",
      "looks like a ten-dollar bill, but turns out to be a clever\n",
      "advertisement, would be picked up and read by everybody.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "838. THE POCKETBOOK FIND.--A clever imitation of a pocketbook would be\n",
      "picked up by every pedestrian, and when it is opened with the\n",
      "expectation of money, one finds instead an advertisement of Pluck &\n",
      "Company.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "839. EVERYBODY’S EAGLE.--A gold (?) eagle with the name of a firm in the\n",
      "place of the usual inscription, will be readily pounced upon, when the\n",
      "lucky finder will learn that “all is not gold that glitters,” but will\n",
      "also learn where and what he can buy to advantage. The firm’s name, of\n",
      "course, is not stamped until the sale of the golden bird is effected.\n",
      "Millions of such eagles could be sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "840. THE WITTY DIALOGUE.--Few things in literature are more attractive\n",
      "than a witty dialogue in which the questions and answers are very short\n",
      "and the denouement is a surprise. If the last word is the magical one of\n",
      "a certain kind of business, such as “Ozone,” “Electrophone,” “----’s\n",
      "Baking Powder,” “----’s Stove Polish,” etc., the maker or merchant will\n",
      "be sure to appreciate it and pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "841. THE STEREOSCOPE BULLETIN.--It pays to give a large sum to the\n",
      "proprietor of a paper who makes a practice of flashing election returns\n",
      "on screens. There is commonly a long wait between the reports, and the\n",
      "vast crowds will meanwhile have nothing to do but study your\n",
      "advertisement flashed between the successive returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "842. THE ARC REFLECTOR.--Have a reflector with an electric light\n",
      "arranged to throw a bright, round light, like the dial of a clock, on\n",
      "the depot platforms, the pavements of crowded streets, or other places\n",
      "where many people congregate. On the background of this strong light let\n",
      "your magic word appear. This is an expensive but very effective way of\n",
      "advertising.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "843. THE LAST SCENE.--Tens of thousands of persons every night are\n",
      "looking upon scenes depicted by the stereoscope. After the “Good Night,”\n",
      "which generally closes the entertainment, immediately, and before the\n",
      "lights are turned on, have your advertisement flashed upon the sheet. As\n",
      "the programme is concluded, the manager would doubtless for a small sum\n",
      "grant a privilege which would be worth many dollars, as no one in the\n",
      "audience can fail to see the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "844. THE RED-LETTER BAT.--For a consideration, the manager of a baseball\n",
      "team would probably let you furnish the players with an excellent bat\n",
      "stamped with your design in large red letters. Your advertisement would\n",
      "flash with every stroke of the bat, and even if many in the crowd were\n",
      "too far away to read the letters, their curiosity would incite them to\n",
      "inquire, and curiosity is the very emotion advertisers seek to arouse.\n",
      "The idea might perhaps be extended to the ball, which is the center of\n",
      "struggle in football matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "845. THE RESTAURANT FAN.--Waiting men will read anything to kill time,\n",
      "but a fan with your enterprise stamped upon it will attract attention,\n",
      "whether one is inclined to read or not. By the hundred thousand these\n",
      "could be produced extremely cheap, and should be presented free to the\n",
      "restaurant keeper. They might also be used in theaters and music halls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "846. THE CIGAR WRAPPER.--It is estimated that 3,000,000 cigars are\n",
      "purchased in New York and vicinity alone every day. For a small sum, say\n",
      "five cents a box, you could doubtless prevail upon most dealers to\n",
      "permit you to wrap each cigar in a piece of paper; especially if the\n",
      "latter were pretty and very attractive, as in the latter case it might\n",
      "even help his sales. The wrapper might contain an alluring picture, but,\n",
      "of course, it contains your advertisement. A small additional sum must\n",
      "be paid a boy for the work of wrapping. As an advertisement, the method\n",
      "would be exceedingly effective, and the idea is certainly a novel one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "847. THE GROWING WORD.--In a reserved space of a daily paper begin with\n",
      "a single glaring letter. Over the letter announce, “Watch this space\n",
      "to-morrow.” The next day another letter is added, and curiosity is\n",
      "excited. If you can get a name for your advertisement similar to the\n",
      "name of a man in the public eye, the success of the scheme is assured.\n",
      "For example, the first letter is G. Is it Grover Cleveland or Garfield?\n",
      "Two letters are given--GA. Is it Garfield or Gage? The third day GAR\n",
      "appears. Is it Garfield or Garland? But in the end it proves to be\n",
      "neither; it is GARLOCK, the name of your invention or brand of goods.\n",
      "Ingenuity can play endlessly upon words in this way, and the curiosity\n",
      "aroused makes it one of the best forms of advertisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "848. THE POLITE STRANGER.--This is a French idea. In Paris a lady is\n",
      "astonished to see a handsome, faultlessly dressed man, generally an\n",
      "elderly person, step directly in front of her, make an extremely polite\n",
      "bow, turn and walk away, when instantly the mystery is solved. On his\n",
      "back appears an advertisement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "849. THE FUNNY QUARTETTE.--This also is from Paris, with adaptations.\n",
      "Four odd people--a little, shabbily dressed old woman, a splendidly\n",
      "attired and pompous gentleman, a country youth in blouse and overalls,\n",
      "and a man in the garb of a priest, make up the queerest quartette\n",
      "imaginable. They at once attract attention, but when they begin to sing\n",
      "a crowd gathers instantly. At the conclusion of the song, one says in a\n",
      "loud tone, “Where?” All reply, “At ----.” “When?” “To-night.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "850. THE STREET BRAWL.--This is on the same line and even more exciting.\n",
      "Readers of “Sherlock Holmes” remember the detective’s ruse to gain\n",
      "entrance to a forbidden house. In the same way, let two men engage in a\n",
      "wordy quarrel. Nothing draws a crowd more quickly than the prospect of a\n",
      "fight. Of course, on a city street the quarrel must not come to actual\n",
      "blows, and the participants must keep an eye open for policemen, but the\n",
      "climax should be the advertisement in the mouth of one or both of the\n",
      "disputants, and the crowd should be dispersed with a hearty laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "851. THE BOX-KITE.--The box-kite presents almost unrivaled opportunities\n",
      "for advertising, and the wonder is that it has not been utilized for\n",
      "that purpose. By a clock-work arrangement and at regular intervals,\n",
      "while the eyes of all are turned skyward, the box releases a host of\n",
      "white leaves, which, floating to the earth, are caught by the crowd.\n",
      "Every leaf contains your advertisement. This method would be especially\n",
      "effective at ball games, horse races, and before election bulletins,\n",
      "while the crowds are waiting for returns or exciting events.\n",

      "The finding and unlocking of the forces of nature have been sources of\n",
      "some of the world’s largest fortunes. Steam and electricity are to-day\n",
      "among the earth’s greatest contributors to wealth. It is not, however,\n",
      "the simple discovery of a new force, but its ingenious application, that\n",
      "brings financial reward, and there may be a hundred, or even a thousand\n",
      "ways of applying a new power. These powers are perhaps all known at the\n",
      "present time, but many of them are little utilized, and some have never\n",
      "been harnessed. It is probable that we have as yet only begun to unlock\n",
      "the secrets of nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "852. COMPRESSED AIR.--There are vast possibilities in the use of this\n",
      "power. In a few years lightning expresses will fly over the land, swift\n",
      "vessels will skim the deep, monster passenger eagles will soar in the\n",
      "air, and tons of mail matter will be blown through tubes from sea to\n",
      "sea, all driven by this powerful motor, compressed air. These things\n",
      "only wait for money and brains.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "853. STEAM.--In the application of steam about ninety per cent. of power\n",
      "is lost. This is an enormous waste. Here is room for a second Watt. In\n",
      "the race for primacy as a power, steam need take no second place if only\n",
      "its unutilized forces be turned to account by some inventor. Here is a\n",
      "field worthy of the noblest powers of man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "854. ELECTRICITY.--At present electricity sends our telegraph messages,\n",
      "projects our voices through the telephone, propels our street cars,\n",
      "lights our streets and dwellings, and in some States executes our\n",
      "criminals. But it is altogether likely that this as yet comparatively\n",
      "unknown power will be extended into a hundred untried fields. Here is a\n",
      "single example of the economy in its use: The Baldwin Locomotive Company\n",
      "discovered that they were losing eighty per cent. of steam power in\n",
      "shafts and belts. They installed electric motors and reduced the bill\n",
      "for power immensely. Hundreds of large establishments waste from\n",
      "one-fourth to three-fourth of steam in the same way. If electricity can\n",
      "save from $14 to $50 per day, as in the case just quoted, it is surely\n",
      "well worth a trial.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "855. CALORIC.--The time will come when the billions of cubic feet of\n",
      "sunlight that fall upon our earth will be utilized and will doubtless be\n",
      "the cheapest and most efficient of all the motor forces. If you can only\n",
      "focus this widely distributed energy, you can obtain any amount of heat\n",
      "and consequently power. It has been proved that you can boil two pints\n",
      "of water with the heat of the sun falling upon one and one-half square\n",
      "yards of surface. One square yard of sunshine represents one horse\n",
      "power. The problem, therefore, is to concentrate. This will be done some\n",
      "day by the use of immense convex mirrors. Already experiments are being\n",
      "tried, and the first promoters of this scheme will have the power of the\n",
      "world at their feet and its wealth in their hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "856. WATER POWER.--The time will also come when the thousands of\n",
      "cataracts and rapids that now waste their energies will all be harnessed\n",
      "and set to work. It is estimated that the water power of Niagara is as\n",
      "great as would be the steam power produced by 226,000,000 tons of coal a\n",
      "year. This one cataract has power enough to make a thousand\n",
      "millionaires, and there are hundreds of smaller waterfalls running to\n",
      "waste.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "857. WINDMILLS.--Steam is costly and water is not always available, but\n",
      "the wind is everywhere, and costs little or nothing. It has the\n",
      "disadvantage of inconstancy and uncertainty, but it is invaluable for\n",
      "storing up force for future use. The windmill is susceptible of great\n",
      "improvements, and waits for another Morse or Watt.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "858. A SAND MILL.--One ingenious man out West has equipped his windmill\n",
      "with an endless belt provided with buckets, like a grain elevator. These\n",
      "dip into a box of dry sand and discharge it upon a large wheel like an\n",
      "overshot water-wheel, which it turns as water would. The sand is\n",
      "discharged again into the box and thus is used over again endlessly. We\n",
      "think the man has not patented his invention; he has missed a fortune\n",
      "which somebody else will pick up.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "859. SEA POWER.--Next to the power of the sun is the power of the ocean.\n",
      "An experiment with a dynanometer has shown that the pressure exerted by\n",
      "the sea waves during a storm often exceeds 7,600 pounds per square\n",
      "foot. Multiply this by 1,393,920,000,000,000 feet, which the surface of\n",
      "the ocean presents, and we gather some little notion of the\n",
      "inconceivable power that is running to waste. When will come the\n",
      "inventor who will harness the sea and set it to lighting our cities and\n",
      "carrying men and mail-bags? There is said to be millions upon millions\n",
      "of gold strewn on the ocean’s bed as the result of wrecks, but there is\n",
      "vastly more gold for the daring inventor in the waves that forever pound\n",
      "upon the beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "860. ARTESIAN WELL.--The artesian well plant is coming into prominence.\n",
      "Formerly the well was only employed as a means of getting water to\n",
      "drink; it is only recently that it has occurred to people that here is\n",
      "an immense and unused water motor. Water power from running streams is\n",
      "only available here and there, but with the advent of the artesian well\n",
      "there is no spot on earth that may not have as much cheap power as it\n",
      "needs, the cost being almost nothing when once the power is obtained.\n",
      "Here is another opportunity for enterprise and fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "861. LIQUID AIR.--This is a new discovery, and one very rich in promise.\n",
      "Here is doubtless the long-sought-for method of the storage battery. It\n",
      "has been found that the same force of liquid air as applied in the\n",
      "electric storage battery scores from one-tenth to one-twentieth more\n",
      "than the electric fluid is able to do. Here we have a power whose\n",
      "application will result in such unknown quantities of usefulness and\n",
      "wealth as to defy the power of figures and even the imagination itself.\n",

      "immense cost and vast number of these buildings, aggregating thousand of\n",
      "millions of dollars, the demand for building materials surpasses all\n",
      "computation and imagination. During the next few decades untold myriads\n",
      "of persons will get rich, either in this discovery of new fields for\n",
      "these materials, exploiting the old ones, or in the invention of new\n",
      "building matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "“How large is your farm?” inquired a lawyer of a verdant farmer whom he\n",
      "meant to guy. The man of the law winked at his companion as much as to\n",
      "say, “See what sport I will have with the old fool!” “Well,” said the\n",
      "haymaker, “I reckon I have about 2,000,000 acres.” “Two million acres!”\n",
      "gasped the attorney, gazing round; “pray, where is it?” “Down yere,”\n",
      "replied the farmer, pointing his long, skinny fingers at the ground. “I\n",
      "have got a hundred acres on top, and I reckon I own about down to the\n",
      "middle of the y’arth.” The man of the soil spake wiser than he knew. He\n",
      "was rich, but not exactly in the way he imagined, for a granite quarry\n",
      "of the finest kind was found on his land, which caused him to realize a\n",
      "large sum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "862. STONE QUARRY.--Says a recent publication: “A man who has a quarry\n",
      "of good building stone, easily accessible, is richer than if he owned a\n",
      "gold mine.” But there are immense numbers of such quarries unworked and\n",
      "even unsuspected. It is not too much to say that there are at least a\n",
      "thousand farmers bemoaning unproductive land which contains beneath the\n",
      "surface that which can make them richer than anything they can possibly\n",
      "grow from the soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "863. ARTIFICIAL STONE.--Many kinds of artificial stone are now employed,\n",
      "such as Ransom’s concrete, Portland stone, etc. They are made by a\n",
      "mixture of cement, sand and gravel, and are molded into blocks. The\n",
      "value depends upon the kind of cement. No really good lime for this\n",
      "purpose has yet been found in the United States. The man who can\n",
      "discover a calcareous deposit capable of making a good, silicious or\n",
      "argillaceous hydraulic lime will have the market for manufactured stone\n",
      "practically in his hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "864. BAKED BRICK.--Late improvements in baking brick have reduced the\n",
      "time required to bake 100,000 bricks from fourteen to four days, and the\n",
      "amount of fuel from forty cords of wood to sixteen. The following\n",
      "suggestions by a brick-burner will show the path of fortune to those who\n",
      "can reduce the time still further. Mix a little charcoal in the clay.\n",
      "Double the length of the brick. If by either of these ways you can make\n",
      "the bricks a trifle cheaper, while retaining their qualities, you have\n",
      "acquired a fortune. “Lucky” Baldwin, a man afterward famous for his\n",
      "mining and real estate speculations, made his first large money in\n",
      "brick-burning. “I had no experience whatever then,” he said, “but I\n",
      "studied up the subject, thoroughly mastered the details, and cleared\n",
      "$1,500 in a month.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "865. GLASS BRICK.--Another new idea! Why not make a brick of glass,\n",
      "partially hollow, so that, filled with rarefied air, it can be a\n",
      "non-conductor of heat? Such a brick would be a great improvement on the\n",
      "present method of constructing conservatories, greenhouses and the walls\n",
      "of winter gardens. The plan is being tried in Europe, but there is no\n",
      "patent on the introduction, and nothing to stop an American from\n",
      "introducing a new kind of hothouse. The adage about the “man in a glass\n",
      "house” may be realized yet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "866. RUBBER FLOORS.--Why do we go on in the old way, employing\n",
      "rough-sounding and creaking flooring, when there is a material which\n",
      "meets every want for a desirable floor? India rubber tiles prevent\n",
      "slipping, emit no sound under the foot, and have the additional element\n",
      "of an agreeable elasticity. It is a positive pleasure to walk on an\n",
      "India rubber floor. It is, of course, more expensive than wood, but the\n",
      "time is surely coming when every elegant dwelling, all expensive halls\n",
      "and public buildings, as well as the saloon decks of our first-class\n",
      "steamships, will have these improved floors. A man, ambitious to be rich\n",
      "and possessing a few thousands of capital, could hardly do a better\n",
      "thing than to manufacture rubber interlocking tiles, advertising them\n",
      "extensively and exhibiting models to builders.\n",

      "be made about the remuneration for this kind of work. There are “stars”\n",
      "at the top who receive from $200 to $1,000 per night, and there are\n",
      "“mediocres,” or worse, at the bottom who barely eke out a living at $7 a\n",
      "week. No one should enter this field unless his talent is equal to his\n",
      "ambition. Here are a few of the prizes taken before the footlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "867. THE FARCE COMEDY.--Evans and Hoey purchased a comedy entitled “A\n",
      "Parlor Match.” Mr. Evans says: “We played it over 3,000 times, and at a\n",
      "rough estimate I think we must have cleared from $300,000 to $400,000.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "868. INSTRUMENTAL CONCERTS.--The possibilities of dollars in\n",
      "instrumental music are seemingly unlimited. Celebrated pianists have\n",
      "received almost fabulous sums. Rubinstein’s six months’ tour in America\n",
      "is said to have netted a profit of $60,000, and a second engagement was\n",
      "made for him at the rate of $2,500 per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "869. STAGE STARS.--The stage, like every other profession, is crowded at\n",
      "the bottom, but has room at the top. Beginners seldom get more than $15\n",
      "per week and commonly they receive much less. Leading people in road\n",
      "companies get $50 per week. Stars receive from $100 to $500 per night.\n",
      "Madame Celeste made $50,000 in this country. Edwin Forrest never\n",
      "received less than $200 per night. Edwin Booth sometimes played for $500\n",
      "per night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "870. POPULAR LECTURERS.--These are richly rewarded for their hour or two\n",
      "of entertainment of an audience. John B. Gough’s price was $200 per\n",
      "night. Henry Ward Beecher, Wendell Phillips, and Bayard Taylor averaged\n",
      "the same figures. The receipts for Professor Tyndall’s thirty-five\n",
      "lectures in this country were $23,100; and Max O’Rell earned $5,290 by\n",
      "his lectures during a single week in Johannesburg, South Africa. Says a\n",
      "magazine note: “Money-making’s most promising field is that of a popular\n",
      "lecturer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "871. HAND SHADOWS.--Here is something new: Some amusement artists in\n",
      "England have conceived the idea of entertaining audiences with hand\n",
      "shadows. A candle, an oil lamp, or an arc light is used, and the beam of\n",
      "light passes through a small circular opening upon a sheet of\n",
      "ticket-writer’s holland. Sometimes a pipe or a piece of cardboard is\n",
      "used to heighten the effect, but for the most part the artist employs\n",
      "his hands only. With diligent practice the most comical effects, such as\n",
      "“Dressing for a Party,” “The Dog Fight,” etc., can be produced. Mr.\n",
      "Devant, the originator of the shadowgraph, convulses his audiences and\n",
      "reaps large profits for himself. America, where the humorous is quickly\n",
      "and keenly appreciated, offers a large field for this new kind of\n",
      "entertainment.\n",

      "Hammerstein, who has just lost all by an unsuccessful venture, says that\n",

      "for this class of entertainers. Of seven leading impersonators now on\n",
      "the platform, four portray his characters almost exclusively. It is a\n",
      "fine field for the elocutionist who has talents for mimicry. The average\n",

      "made to give forth musical sounds has vastly widened the field of\n",
      "entertainment. Rocks, steam pipes, tumblers, and dinner bells have been\n",
      "drafted into service, the last named with notable success. In one\n",
      "company four young ladies have charmed the public ear with the melody of\n",
      "a score of hand bells. They have reaped rich harvests all over the\n",
      "country.\n",

      "884. MAGICIANS.--This field has been somewhat overworked of late years,\n",
      "but the phenomenal success of such men as Blitz, the ventriloquist, and\n",
      "Hermann, the prestidigitator, show the possibilities in this line. Both\n",

      "885. STORY TELLERS.--This is a late revival of a form of amusement as\n",
      "old as the times of Homer. Those succeed best who are authors as well as\n",
      "elocutionists, making their own story and telling it fresh from the\n",

      "their work, as this kind of talent is rare. The chief of this class of\n",
      "artists received from $50 to $150 per night. Since his death, no worthy\n",
      "successor has been found, but there are many young fingers that are\n",

      "because it is found almost everywhere. Some of the best shooting is\n",
      "found in North Carolina and Maryland, where a hunter of average skill\n",
      "can bag fifty birds a day. Price, $1.75 per dozen, or $7 for his day’s\n",

      "necessary to slaughter annually for the decoration of ladies’ hats\n",
      "amounts to the enormous number of 9,250,000. These are mostly tropical\n",

      "of these bright wings can easily bag $10 worth of the birds in a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "889. IVORY.--Elephant hunting in Africa is very profitable for those who\n",
      "have the courage and taste for the work. Seventy-five thousand elephants\n",
      "are slain yearly to supply the world’s knife-handles, billiard balls,\n",
      "and piano keys. There are a number of persons engaged in the killing of\n",
      "elephants for the sake of the sport, but most hunters do so for the\n",
      "profit. Ivory is worth about $1 a pound, and the tusks of a male\n",
      "elephant weigh about fifty pounds. The average of one elephant a day is\n",
      "considered a good day’s work, although five or six have been taken under\n",
      "the most favorable circumstances. The safest plan is by means of a\n",

      "who own ponds which they have stocked with trout, and which they sell\n",
      "for $1 apiece; and this price they often receive even when the buyer as\n",
      "sportsman catches them himself. The profits of fish raising lie in the\n",
      "fact that fish are prolific to an extent vastly greater than any other\n",
      "creatures used for human food, the female sometimes laying as many as\n",
      "150,000 eggs. There are owners of trout preserves who receive as high as\n",

      "and in the North Woods of the United States have always been very\n",
      "profitable. Here is a list of the number of furs taken, with a few of\n",
      "the prices obtained: A good sable skin brings from $20 to $150,\n",
      "according to quality; 15,000 are caught yearly. Almost as valuable is\n",
      "the fur of the pine marten; 200,000 skins taken annually. Another\n",
      "high-priced skin is that of the mink; 250,000 are taken every year. The\n",
      "ermine is another choice fur, of which 400,000 are taken yearly. A\n",
      "beautiful material for robes, ladies’ sets, trimmings, etc., is the fur\n",
      "of the Canada lynx, of which 50,000 are taken yearly. The fur of the\n",
      "otter is much esteemed for caps, collars, and gloves; 40,000 taken\n",
      "yearly. Almost the same number of beavers are captured every year; the\n",
      "fur is used for caps and mufflers. Three million muskrat skins are in\n",
      "demand every year. Of all kinds of foxes some 200,000 find their way\n",
      "into our markets or are exported to Europe. The skin of the silver fox\n",
      "of Labrador has been sold in London for $500. The raccoon furnishes us\n",
      "yearly with 500,000 skins, and the badger with 50,000. We have as a\n",

      "Wolverine State, according to Government estimate, reaches the enormous\n",
      "amount of 41,000,000,000 feet. There are many fortunes yet to be carved\n",

      "of revenue. The work is light, pleasant and romantic.\n",

      "together with his brother, after many experiments, announced that they\n",
      "had discovered a process for extracting gold from the sea. A stock\n",
      "company was formed, a large capital raised, and a mill erected. But the\n",
      "bubble exploded with loss to all except the reverend projector of the\n",
      "enterprise, who is said to have made $100,000 out of the scheme. At\n",
      "least, a loose leaf from his ledger, which he left behind in his flight,\n",
      "indicates that about that sum was inveigled from the pockets of the\n",
      "deluded members of the “company.” However, some of them still have faith\n",
      "in the enterprise. It has been known to chemists for a long time that\n",
      "gold is contained in sea water. The only question is whether it is in\n",
      "sufficient quantities to pay for the cost of its extraction. It may yet\n",
      "be found that what is at present regarded as a gigantic swindle contains\n",
      "the seeds of a profitable industry.\n",

      "destruction of by far the most valuable of all our fertilizers, which\n",
      "passes out of our sewers into the sea, and is lost. It is estimated that\n",
      "the amount in New York City alone is worth over $5,000,000 yearly. In\n",

      "907. WASTE OF COAL ASHES.--Two hundred million tons of coal are\n",
      "consumed annually in this country. About one-half of this amount goes to\n",
      "ashes. It is safe to say that, after all the cinders and slag have been\n",
      "sifted out, there are still 100,000,000 truck loads which are worse than\n",
      "wasted, as they threaten to hinder the free navigation of our harbor.\n",

      "fortunes by its sale to farmers and gardeners.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "908. WASTE OF GARBAGE.--Shoreditch, population, 124,000, a borough of\n",
      "London, by a new system for the disposal of garbage, called the Dust\n",
      "Destructor, saved in one year $11,000, or enough to defray the expense\n",

      "City (not the Greater New York) the number of truck loads last year was\n",
      "1,582,287, and it is estimated that a similar system, in place of the\n",
      "one which now costs the city ninety-four cents per load, would save\n",
      "$712,132, equivalent to the interest at six per cent. on a capital of\n",
      "$11,868,675, or more than sufficient to light the whole of Manhattan\n",
      "Island.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "909. WASTE OF SULPHUR.--Attention has recently been called to the\n",
      "enormous waste of sulphur which is going on in the copper furnaces of\n",
      "Western mining towns. It is said that the annual waste is 128,000 tons.\n",
      "The price of sulphur is $32 a ton. Where is the man who will stop the\n",
      "pouring out of this vast quantity of poisonous vapor upon the\n",
      "atmosphere, save the enormous waste of valuable material, and make for\n",
      "himself a gigantic fortune? The lists are open.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "910. WASTE OF TIN.--Thousands of tons of tin cans are daily thrown in\n",
      "the rubbish heap. It is believed that by treatment of sulphate the tin\n",
      "may be recovered and again utilized. It is a question whether the same\n",
      "amount of money now invested in tin mines, if put to this novel use,\n",
      "would not be the better paying investment. It is estimated that there\n",
      "are two cents’ worth of tin in an average-sized can. Cans could be\n",
      "collected at a cost of fifty cents per hundred, or $5,000 per million.\n",
      "If we estimate the chemical process of recovering the tin at as much\n",
      "more, the total cost would be $10,000 per million cans. Worth of the tin\n",
      "recovered at two cents per can, $20,000. Profits, 100 per cent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "911. WASTE OF HEAT.--In our present systems of heating, from one-fourth\n",
      "to one-third of the heat passes up the chimney and is lost. Could not\n",
      "some method be perfected by which this could be saved? It would be a\n",
      "great boon to the poor, who need to save every pound of coal, if this\n",
      "could be done. We suggest as one plan a stovepipe radiator--two pipes,\n",
      "open at top and bottom, traversing the vertical leg of the smoke-flue,\n",
      "by means of which the air of the room shall be taken in at one end and\n",
      "sent out at the other. There are at least 100,000 apartments heated by\n",
      "steam. A system which will add one-fourth to the heat of these rooms\n",
      "will be a material blessing. There should be millions in the invention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "912. WASTE OF LAND.--Judge Emory, at a recent irrigation convention,\n",
      "stated that the arid and semi-arid lands of the United States are\n",
      "one-half as large as all our domain, except Alaska. It is estimated\n",
      "that good homes, fit for 75,000,000 to 150,000,000 people, could be made\n",
      "by irrigation. This system is yet in its infancy. In a few years\n",
      "hundreds of millions of dollars will be invested in making our desert\n",
      "lands “blossom as the rose,” but like all other enterprises, first on\n",
      "the field will be the first in fortune.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "913. WASTE OF GOLD, SILVER AND IRON.--The present clumsy methods of\n",
      "extracting the ore of metals must soon be superseded by a more\n",
      "economical system. To say that there are $100,000,000 worth of gold and\n",
      "silver in the refuse piled up around the mines would be much beneath the\n",
      "actual figures. The loss in iron and other metals, owing to the same\n",
      "cause, is utterly incalculable. The recent discoveries in magnetism\n",
      "point to the solution of the problem and the utilization of the waste.\n",
      "It is not impossible that the electro-magnet contains more gold for its\n",
      "fortunate inventors than all the mines of the earth will yield to\n",

      "some marry it. Every year new schemes are developed for the earning of\n",
      "one’s bread. Many of them are unpromising and even startling, and yet\n",
      "all the great industries that to-day pour wealth into the pockets of the\n",
      "capitalists were once derided as the folly of unpractical dreamers.\n",
      "There is not one of the thousand or more methods of making a living in\n",
      "which there is not the possibility of a fortune. The following methods\n",
      "are sufficiently out of the beaten track to be novel to most people,\n",
      "while some of them are absolutely new and untried:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "914. THE NATIONAL ADVERTISING COMPANY.--Form a company of live,\n",
      "energetic, intelligent young men. Ascertain the extent of circulation of\n",
      "some of our literary magazines. For every subscriber and buyer there are\n",
      "at least three readers; some estimate five. Bunch together the\n",
      "circulation of some of the leading periodicals, and when you are sure of\n",
      "a million readers, begin operations. Divide the country up into\n",
      "sections, with a central headquarters, and let one of a pair of your\n",
      "young men work each. One member of the firm remains to control the\n",
      "office. The magazines should be those whose circulation covers the\n",
      "entire country, and the advertisements you seek to gain should not be of\n",
      "a local but of a general character. Then you can work your field,\n",
      "promising that for so many cents per thousand or dollars per million,\n",
      "you will place the advertisements before the eyes of that number of\n",
      "people. Have circulars headed “Millions for Cents.” The power of numbers\n",
      "has a charm for most people, and few advertisers will be able to resist\n",
      "your array of figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "915. FREE RENT.--Get your rent free on the same plan that some men get a\n",
      "building lot free. Take a large house, which, we will say, costs you $75\n",
      "per month. Such a house should have at least twelve rooms, six of which\n",
      "should be bedrooms. These rooms should be readily sublet for $3 a week,\n",
      "which, allowing for the fractions over the even weeks in a month,\n",
      "exactly pays your rent. By means of folding-beds you can readily convert\n",
      "some of the remaining six into sleeping rooms. If your family is small,\n",
      "a parlor can be so used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "916. X-RAYS AND X-BILLS.--The fluoroscope is a new thing. It is a great\n",
      "thing to see the bones of one’s hands, or keys imbedded in two inches of\n",
      "solid wood. You can invent many other ways of making the novelty\n",
      "interesting. People pay to see what is novel. With proper advertising, a\n",
      "really good fluoroscope exhibition should net at least $10 a night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "917. GOLDEN SAILS.--Cleopatra’s barge may not have had golden sails, but\n",
      "if you live along shore, especially near a summer resort, you can turn\n",
      "your sails into gold, and make the wind waft you money by taking parties\n",
      "for an outing on the water. You should get $10 for a party of six; $15\n",
      "for a party of ten, etc. The requisites are a good boat, made attractive\n",
      "by awning and colored cushions, fishing tackle, bait, etc., and a\n",
      "pleasant, obliging disposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "918. GAME PRESERVE.--If you live far inland, you can buy at cheap rates\n",
      "a wild mountain or a large tract of wilderness. Around this construct a\n",
      "high fence and stock your purchase with game. All this will require\n",
      "capital, but you will find ample returns for your investment in the\n",
      "rates which you will charge city sportsmen for a day’s sport. These\n",
      "hunters care little for the money if they can have a good day’s sport.\n",
      "After your game preserve becomes well known, through liberal\n",
      "advertising, $25 a day on your investment during the season should be a\n",
      "very modest expectation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "919. THE JUNK SHOP.--One of the things most in demand to-day is iron.\n",
      "This is the iron age. It is displacing brick for building and wood for\n",
      "ships. And yet how much goes to waste! Stoves, pots, kettles, rails,\n",
      "machinery, wagon springs, car wheels, pillars, girders, and a multitude\n",
      "of other forms of this valuable metal go to waste. The junk shop is a\n",
      "mine. Manufacturers will pay you fifty cents per 100 pounds. The fact is\n",
      "not generally known, but many junk dealers have become rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "920. OLD NEWSPAPERS.--Newspapers should not be sold to the ragman until\n",
      "they have been scissored, and perhaps not then. In New York there is a\n",
      "man who makes a business of preserving newspapers. You can get almost\n",
      "any copy of any paper for a number of years back. Copies forty years old\n",
      "bring as high as $20 apiece. A copy twenty years old will bring $4 or\n",
      "$5. Copies more than one year old and less than five sell from fifty\n",
      "cents to one dollar. If salable, every day increases the value of your\n",
      "stock.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "921. THE BOOK STALL.--Where come the books on the street stalls that\n",
      "sell for such marvelously low prices? From the cellars (would-be\n",
      "sellers) of publication houses. These are the books that will not sell\n",
      "at rates profitable to the publishers, and are bought up by the thousand\n",
      "at small rates. Many of them come from the libraries of persons\n",
      "deceased, and from the bookcases of men tired of carting them around in\n",
      "this moving age. Sold at fifteen, twenty or twenty-five cents apiece,\n",
      "there is a large profit in these books, for they are often bought at $10\n",
      "per thousand--that is, a penny apiece. Profits at ten cents, 900 per\n",
      "cent. Bought at $50 per thousand, you have still 400 per cent. Pretty\n",
      "fair profits indeed! Let us no longer despise the old dealer in\n",
      "second-hand books.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "922. OLD FURNITURE.--Furniture made of the best material brings large\n",
      "prices. Only slightly marred, chairs and other kinds of household\n",
      "furniture often made of costly woods, are stored away as useless in the\n",
      "attic. These could frequently be purchased at very low prices, the\n",
      "owners being glad to get rid of them as an incumbrance. Yet a little\n",
      "money would make them as good as new. Five dollars expended on a chair\n",
      "that originally cost $50 and was repurchased in a dilapidated state for\n",
      "$10; it was sold by the adroit second-hand dealer for $25; and the\n",
      "purchaser considered it an excellent bargain. The dealer’s profit was\n",
      "$10. Time consumed in repair, one day and a half. The man earned\n",
      "$6.66-1/3 per day. Some in the same line have done much better. With\n",
      "competent helpers and with industry in hunting up old furniture, these\n",
      "figures should be trebled and quadrupled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "923. PUBLIC CONVENIENCE ROOM.--Establish it on some prominent\n",
      "thoroughfare. It need not be very large. Suppose the rent to be $25 per\n",
      "month. Let it be understood that for five cents you will furnish\n",
      "materials for correspondence (pen, ink and paper), a writing desk,\n",
      "brushes band lacking for shoes (not the services of a bootblack), a\n",
      "whisk broom, a mirror, the use of a daily paper, a city directory, a\n",
      "large map of the city, information on points of interest concerning the\n",
      "things worth seeing, directions how to reach any part of the city, sofas\n",
      "and easy chairs for resting, and the use of a toilet room. All for five\n",
      "cents! You should have at least 200 patrons a day; receipts, $10.\n",
      "Besides, you could sell stationery, confectionery, cigars, magazines,\n",
      "and many other small articles in common use. The place could\n",
      "advantageously be established in connection with a restaurant. Do you\n",
      "know that some of the largest fortunes have been made from just such\n",
      "five-cent charges. A millionaire street-railroad magnate, being asked\n",
      "recently what his business was, replied: “Oh! just a five-cent\n",
      "business--that’s all.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "924. GENERAL ADVICE.--Here is something entirely new: Thousands of\n",
      "people want information, but do not know where to get it. Some write to\n",
      "the newspapers, some ask friends. It would be of great advantage if such\n",
      "persons could consult people who have more time to look into their\n",
      "affairs than a newspaper editor, and who are more disinterested than\n",
      "friends. Let it be known that you will give tips on horse races, inside\n",
      "information about stock, points about the purchase of real estate,\n",
      "advice about law matters, suggestions about the investment of money, or\n",
      "any other information that may be required. Have on hand a stock of\n",
      "dictionaries, gazetteers, directories, encyclopedias, and world books of\n",
      "general information. You may charge ten cents for a simple consultation\n",
      "of five minutes. You can give a great deal of information in five\n",
      "minutes, if your questioner knows how to ask and you how to answer.\n",
      "Fifteen cents for ten minutes, twenty-five cents for twenty minutes,\n",
      "thirty-five cents for an half hour, and half a dollar for an hour. This\n",
      "business might be combined with the Public Convenience Room in the last\n",
      "number.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "925. LANGUAGE CLASSES.--Here is one on a new plan. A French teacher has\n",
      "hit upon the idea of combining work and play in a novel manner. The\n",
      "classes form a club, which meets as in progressive euchre. The game is\n",
      "played after the old style of authors. Upon blank white cards are\n",
      "written the words to be used in sentences at the table. One table has\n",
      "cards containing the names of clothing, another of furniture, and so on.\n",
      "The players remain a certain length of time at each table, and then pass\n",
      "to the next, each player visiting every table during the session of the\n",
      "club. Afterward light refreshments are served by the teacher, and the\n",
      "subjects announced for the next meeting. The idea is a taking one, and\n",
      "capable of great elaboration. An up-to-date teacher ought to have\n",
      "immense success with this plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "926. BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.--The business opportunities advertised in\n",
      "a single New York paper average 25 a day, 200 on Sunday, or about 17,500\n",
      "a year. One man claims that $10,000 can be realized in two weeks by the\n",
      "opportune venture of $1,000 in real estate. Another offers stock in a\n",
      "$10,000 mine which he is sure will shortly be worth $100,000. A third\n",
      "offers $5,000 for the use of $3,000 one year in mining operations. A\n",
      "fourth wants a backer for a new power, in which $5,000,000 will be\n",
      "easily realized. Most of these “opportunities” are doubtless illusive,\n",
      "while many are bare-faced frauds; yet among the myriads there may be\n",
      "some genuine chances for money-making. A shrewd man might find a bonanza\n",
      "in this mine of opportunities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "927. MINE OWNERS.--Mr. Demullers, of Jefferson County, N. Y., a few\n",
      "years ago went to El Paso, Mexico, as a workman. To-day he owns the most\n",
      "valuable turquoise mine in the world, and is known as the “Turquoise\n",
      "King.” One recent shipment netted him $10,000. Another man in South\n",
      "America is known as the “Nitrate King,” and is said to be the richest\n",
      "man on the Western Continent. He also was once a poor man.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "928. CATTLE RAISERS.--Six years ago Grant Gillet was a station agent in\n",
      "a small town in Kansas, working for a bare living. He made an engagement\n",
      "as cattle feeder, and from that position worked himself up into wealth\n",
      "by buying and selling cattle. He actually made half a million dollars in\n",
      "four years, and was known as the Millionaire Cowboy. Another man this\n",
      "last year bought Texas cattle for $432,000, and sold them for $540,000,\n",
      "making $108,000 in four months. This simply shows what opportunities\n",
      "there are for shrewd men in the cattle business.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "929. STUMP SPEAKERS.--Men of oratorical ability have an opportunity\n",
      "during two or three months of every year to earn considerable money in\n",
      "political campaigns. Both of the great parties employ the best talent,\n",
      "the pay depending partly upon one’s convincing logic, but mainly upon\n",
      "the celebrity of the speaker. The lowest compensation is $5 a night, but\n",
      "noted speakers have received $100, and even more, for one short speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "930. ARTISTIC HOME BUILDERS.--These are not speculators, but men who\n",
      "have built homes for their own occupancy, yet have been induced to sell\n",
      "by the high prices offered. We know of no less than three persons in\n",

      "931. CEMETERY OWNERS.--Cemetery lots have proved good paying property to\n",
      "those who know how to manage it. Land which costs from $1,000 to $5,000\n",
      "an acre is divided up into parcels one rod or one-half rod square, and\n",
      "sold for from $100 to $500 a plot. Mr. Th. E. Tinsley became a\n",
      "millionaire through graveyard operations in Texas.\n",
      "\n",

      "932. GLASS BALL SHOOTERS.--The names of Carver and Bogardus have become\n",
      "continental by reason of their skill in hitting glass balls shot out of\n",
      "a trap. There is hardly any kind of sport more exciting, and there is\n",

      "pocketed fortunes by the exhibition of their skill.\n",

      "and amuse its patrons. The manager, by having several engagements on\n",

      "annually sold in New York, 65,000 quarts a day being the average\n",
      "consumption in warm weather. “It is nothing,” says a prominent maker,\n",
      "“for a great establishment to dispose of 35,000 quarts in one day.” An\n",
      "idea of the money in the business may be formed from the fact that the\n",
      "value of the annual output is about $3,500,000, of which fully one-third\n",
      "is profit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "935. GOLD HUNTERS.--F. E. Simmons, of Montana, went to the Klondike less\n",
      "than a year ago. He suffered every hardship and nearly lost his life on\n",
      "the journey, but he returned with half a million dollars. There are a\n",
      "few prizes there, as in all mining districts, but the majority of gold\n",
      "hunters do not succeed. Yet Mr. J. Partridge, a mining expert, who has\n",
      "thoroughly examined the region, says the wealth of the Klondike is\n",
      "inexhaustible, and he predicts that $30,000,000 will be taken out next\n",
      "year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "936. ASPHALT COMPANIES.--Here is an example of the enormous profits made\n",
      "by these companies. In one city the mayor, suspecting the charges were\n",
      "exorbitant, forced them to a lower scale, when the company actually\n",
      "agreed to do for $1.50 per yard what they had hitherto received $2.25\n",
      "for laying. This last was a living profit, but the profits over and\n",
      "above a fair compensation were seventy-five cents per square yard. This\n",
      "is the way contractors for the government get rich.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "937. HORSE JOCKEYS.--Small men weighing not over 100 pounds have an\n",
      "opportunity to earn money by riding horses on the race track. As the\n",
      "race often depends upon the judgment, skill, and balance of the rider,\n",
      "the owner wants the qualities of a man in the body of a boy. Jockeys\n",
      "receive on different tracks from $10 to $25 for their day’s work, but\n",
      "riders of winners often receive presents of $10 and even more. Tod\n",
      "Sloan, a rider for the Dwyers, it is said, received $1,000 for a trip to\n",
      "the English Derby.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "938. WIG MAKING.--In a large city where there are several theaters, you\n",
      "can do a good business in wigmaking. The trade is easily learned, and\n",
      "the goods will command prices varying from the mustache of fifty cents\n",
      "to the court wig for which you should receive $7 or $8. A location near\n",
      "a large theater is desirable. Actors are very fastidious about their\n",
      "make-up, and willing to pay good prices. It is said that Edwin Forrest\n",
      "once paid $300 for a striking wig.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "939. BOOK REPAIRING.--Almost everybody has books that are out of order,\n",
      "and yet, strange to say, we have never heard of any one making a\n",
      "business of repairing books. For your outfit you need several sheets of\n",
      "paper of different sizes and thickness, a few strips of leather, some\n",
      "stout pieces of cloth, a bottle of glue, a penknife, and a pair of\n",
      "scissors. These can be carried in a small hand bag. Practice on your own\n",
      "and your friends’ books before striking out.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "940. THE HOUSEHOLD PACK.--Select twenty-five articles most needed in a\n",
      "household. They should be compact, so as to go in a small box or bag.\n",
      "They should be such things as soap, starch, shoe blacking, shoe polish,\n",
      "stove blacking, cement, mucilage, matches, bluing, yeast cakes, baking\n",
      "powders, etc. These are articles in constant demand and consumption.\n",
      "They can be sold from door to door, mostly among people of limited\n",
      "means, and if sold cheap there is profit, because they are articles\n",
      "which every one wants, and many sales, even if the profits are small,\n",
      "mean large results. There are many peddlers who are foreigners, and\n",
      "having made a competence, go back to their own country to enjoy it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "941. PAWNBROKERS’ PROFITS.--The pawnbrokers’ business has been largely\n",
      "given up to the Jews, but there is no good reason why it should be.\n",
      "Pawnbrokers make immense profits. The amount of the loan is not above\n",
      "one-third the value of the article. The goods are frequently not\n",
      "redeemed. Then there are the pawnbrokers’ sales, at which the articles\n",
      "command at least one-half their value. The pawnbroker gets ten per cent.\n",
      "or more on money loaned, and if the goods are sold he gets the\n",
      "difference between one-third and one-half values; that is, if an article\n",
      "be worth $100, the loan is $33.33-1/3. The amount realized at the sale\n",
      "is $50. Pawnbrokers’ profits, $16.66-2/3. This is the reason most\n",

      "Ferdinand Ward, called the Napoleon of Finance, had an unequaled gift\n",

      "\n",
      "Cornelius Vanderbilt at twenty earned a living by rowing a boat between\n",

      "\n",
      "Of the last named it may be mentioned--to show how little a college\n",
      "education has to do with success in business--that he was very\n",
      "illiterate, possessing only a scanty knowledge of grammar, and even of\n",
      "spelling. It is related that on one occasion he told his cashier that he\n",
      "would set the safe lock on the word “door.” When the cashier wanted to\n",
      "open the safe, he tried “door” in vain. Knowing his employer’s queer\n",
      "methods of spelling he tried varieties on “door,” such as “dore,”\n",
      "“doar,” etc., but all in vain. At last he was obliged to go to the hotel\n",
      "and awake his employer, who had gone to bed. “Uncle Dan’l” was quite\n",
      "crusty at being awakened, and told his cashier again that he had set the\n",
      "safe on the word “door.” “But how do you spell ‘door’?” inquired the\n",
      "cashier. “Why,” said “Uncle Dan’l” tartly, “any fool can spell ‘door.’\n",
      "You’d better get out of the business if you can’t spell, and I’ve a\n",
      "mind to discharge you on the spot. How do I spell ‘door?’ Why,\n",
      "‘d-o-a-r-e,’ of course!” The next day, however, on reflection the old\n",
      "man relented, and concluded not to discharge his trusted employee for so\n",
      "trivial a blunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "A rule for speculators is: “Don’t invest on professional advice.” Your\n",
      "advisers have “an ax to grind.” A man once ordered a broker to buy 1,000\n",
      "shares of Erie when the price was 94; it immediately dropped, and he\n",
      "ordered it sold when it was 92-1/2. In half an hour he returned and\n",
      "ordered it bought again. It had then gone up to 95. After consulting\n",
      "again with “friends,” he again ordered it sold. The market then was down\n",
      "to 90. He came back the fifth time and said: “I consulted one man who\n",
      "told me to buy; then another who told me to sell. I understand that one\n",
      "is called a bull and the other a bear. I don’t know much about these\n",
      "names, but I do know that I have been a jackass.”\n",
      "\n",
      "A much safer plan is to follow the lead of shrewd speculators. In Wall\n",
      "Street you should reverse the advice given to the disciples concerning\n",
      "the Pharisees. Christ said, “Do as they say, but not as they do.” But\n",
      "with speculators the direction should be, “Do as they do, but not as\n",
      "they say.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief form of speculation is in stocks. These stocks may be\n",
      "railroads, mines, wheat, corn, cotton, wool, tobacco, oil, gas, coal,\n",
      "and, in fact, almost any industry where capital has constantly\n",
      "vacillating values. We have room to mention only a very few:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "942. CITY BONDS.--These are generally among the best securities for\n",
      "investment. The element of speculation comes in when they are bought\n",
      "below par in the belief of an early rise. A sharp Yankee bought $100,000\n",
      "of defaulted bonds of the city of Houston, Texas, forced a settlement at\n",
      "par, and doubled his money.\n",
      "\n",

      "943. COLONIAL TRADE.--We have the very best authority for the\n",
      "information that the trade in our newly acquired territory, the\n",
      "Philippine Islands, will be worth one billion dollars annually under\n",
      "American development. Here is an immense opportunity for every form of\n",
      "profitable speculation. Cuba, Porto Rico, and Hawaii, also, are inviting\n",
      "fields, and there is no doubt that the next decade will witness the\n",
      "making of many fortunes in those islands, and the foundations of\n",
      "hundreds of others. Now is the time to begin, as those earliest in the\n",

      "\n",
      "944. THE AMERICAN TOBACCO COMPANY.--One of the most vacillating stocks\n",
      "lately has been that of the American Tobacco Company. In January of the\n",
      "current year--1898--Mr. J. R. Keene purchased 80,000 shares at $90.\n",
      "September 26th, fearing the market was about to decline, he began to\n",
      "sell, and in two days had completely unloaded at figures ranging at $145\n",
      "to $139. He cleared about $1,500,000 in the two days.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "945. COLLAPSED RAILROADS.--For a capitalist there are few more promising\n",
      "fields than the buying up of collapsed or run down railroads. Mr. George\n",
      "I. Seney accumulated a large fortune by purchasing at a little more than\n",
      "nominal figures bankrupt or embarrassed roads, and by thorough\n",
      "equipment, and by connection with more prosperous roads, soon put them\n",
      "in a paying condition. If you can get one end of a small road into a\n",
      "large city, or if you can arrange to make it the feeder instead of the\n",
      "rival of a large road, it will be almost certain to yield abundant\n",

      "every great center of the world, and in this period of less than a year\n",
      "he actually made $4,500,000. True, he lost it again, but the fact that\n",
      "one could corner such a fortune in so short a time shows what may be\n",
      "accomplished with courage and capital. The safest rule for small and\n",
      "timid operators is to follow in the wake of these bold speculators, but\n",
      "not too far. It may be laid down almost with the certainty of a logical\n",
      "premise, that, when a man of vast resources and thoroughly familiar with\n",
      "the field enters the market, he is bound to win at first, but bound to\n",
      "lose if he presses things too far, because the tremendous stress\n",
      "produces at last reactionary conditions which no manipulator and no\n",
      "combination of speculators are able to face. It does not matter so much\n",

      "stock in eighteen years from $110,000 to $30,000,000. In that time it\n",
      "has earned $42,903,680. It pays dividends of eighteen per cent., and\n",
      "could pay more, if allowed to do so by its charter. The surplus is used\n",
      "to increase the capital stock, so that in addition to its enormous\n",

      "are chiefly obscure people who pay from $1 to $10 to have their history,\n",
      "home, achievements, or virtues lauded in verse. It is hardly necessary\n",

      "984. OLD COINS.--Some have found a profitable source of revenue in the\n",

      "dollar coin of 1804 for $5,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "985. PURVEYOR OF PERSONALS.--A Russian named Romeitre started this\n",
      "enterprise in a small way. Now we have press-clipping bureaus so large\n",
      "as to employ seventy persons each. In some of these places from 5,000 to\n",
      "7,000 papers are read every day, and the weekly clippings amount to more\n",

      "men’s misfortunes; that is, by stripping wrecks of their valuables.\n",
      "Others secure the services of divers and search the bottom of the\n",
      "ocean, where vessels containing treasures are supposed to have gone\n",
      "down. A few years ago a company from England went with divers to a place\n",
      "near Bermuda, where a vessel had been sunk a long time before, and\n",
      "secured from the wreck the sum of $1,500,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "987. RARE BOOKS.--The art of book collecting has been pursued with\n",
      "profit by some persons. It requires no capital, if one simply confines\n",
      "his efforts to book-stalls, though, if pursued on a large scale, money\n",
      "is required for advertising and correspondence. Mr. Charles B. Foote, of\n",
      "New York City, is a veteran bibliophile, and has made a specialty of\n",
      "first editions. Recently he made three auction sales of his stores, and\n",
      "realized more than $20,000, and his home is full of treasures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "988. OLD ITALIAN VIOLINS.--They sell at prices ranging from $500 to\n",
      "$5,000, when you can buy them at all, which is seldom, for they are\n",
      "mostly in the hands of wealthy collectors. Now we will let you into a\n",
      "great secret. It is not the kind of wood or the form of the instrument\n",
      "alone which produces the rare quality of sound, but it lies also in the\n",
      "kind of varnish used. By experimenting with varnish, you can produce a\n",
      "“Stradivarius,” which will sell for almost any amount you choose to ask.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "989. MAGIC SILK.--It seems like the trick of the magician to speak of\n",
      "turning cotton into silk, but it can actually be done, or at least\n",
      "cotton can be made to resemble silk, so that discrimination between the\n",
      "two fabrics is impossible. About fifty years ago, one Mercer, a French\n",
      "chemist, showed that cotton when subjected to the action of concentrated\n",
      "acid or alkalies, contracts and has a greater affinity for dyes, but it\n",
      "has only just been discovered that “mercerization” gives also a\n",
      "brilliant luster to the cotton. The cotton is stretched violently during\n",
      "the operation, and when an energetic rubbing is added to the tension the\n",
      "tissue receives a permanent luster. It thus replaces silk at a fraction\n",
      "of its cost, and offers a splendid chance for financial enterprise.\n",
      "\n",

      "990. THE GOLD CURE.--If the gold cure for which so much is claimed can\n",
      "really take away the appetite for liquor, there is an immense field for\n",
      "its exercise and room for the making of many fortunes in the cure of\n",
      "America’s drunkards. In the United States alone an exceedingly moderate\n",
      "estimate makes the number of this unfortunate class 1,600,000. At the\n",
      "very modest calculation that only one-tenth of these can be induced to\n",
      "try the cure, and if each case nets the proprietor of the institution\n",
      "only $25--and the estimate should probably be doubled and even\n",
      "trebled--there are $15,000,000 in it for the public benefactors who can\n",
      "thus curb the evil of dram-drinking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "991. THE TELEPHONE NEWSPAPER.--Here is an idea for newspaper men: In\n",
      "Budapest, Hungary, there is a telephone newspaper, the first and only\n",
      "one in the world. The main office is in telephone communication with the\n",
      "Reichstadt (corresponding to our Congress), and it often happens that\n",
      "important speeches are known to the public while the speaker is still\n",
      "addressing the house; the latest reports from stock exchanges as well as\n",
      "political news are heard before any paper has printed them, a short\n",
      "summary of all important items is given at noon and again in the\n",
      "evening; subscribers are entertained with music and literary articles in\n",
      "the evenings, the latter being often spoken into the telephone by the\n",
      "original authors. The cost is only two cents a day, and the company are\n",
      "said to be making money even at that figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "992. RACE AND STOCK TIPPERS.--In addition to the regular brokers who\n",
      "supply tips to their customers, there is now a set of professional\n",
      "tippers who profess to have “inside information,” and make it a business\n",
      "to give tips to anybody who will pay for them. They receive in some\n",
      "cases a fixed sum from their patrons, and in other cases they take a\n",
      "liberal percentage of the profits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "993. PROMOTERS.--This is a new vocation. The promoter “promotes”\n",
      "anything and everything that will pay. If you want to accomplish\n",
      "anything from the launching of a railroad enterprise to the selling of a\n",
      "penny patent, you pay the “promoter” a certain sum to do the work. He\n",
      "buys influence, lobbies legislators, controls newspapers and hypnotizes\n",
      "the public generally. Not all promoters come as high as Mr. Ernest\n",
      "Tooley, whose own price can be imagined when he claims to have paid\n",
      "$250,000 to English peers for their influence; yet we learn that the\n",
      "American Tin Plate Company gave the promoters of the Trust $10,000,000\n",

      "994. ELECTRICAL EXPERTS.--The use of electricity has so increased in the\n",
      "last few years, and so many new uses have been found for it, that there\n",
      "are to-day nearly fifty different departments of human labor where it is\n",
      "employed, and naturally these have differentiated as many kinds of\n",
      "electricians. A young man in a New York establishment says “I am in\n",
      "receipt of a salary of $4,000 as superintendent of the dynamo building,\n",
      "and recently I had an offer of $7,000 to go with a new company out\n",
      "West.”\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "995. THE CONFIDENTIAL MAN.--Another man in New York began his career in\n",
      "a store at wages of only $7 a week. He is now the firm’s confidential\n",
      "man, who decides on all important purchases, and receives a salary of\n",
      "$8,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "996. THE ADVERTISING AGENT.--The advertising agency is from a financial\n",
      "standpoint the most important department in the make-up of a paper or\n",
      "periodical. On one of our most popular magazines there is to-day a young\n",
      "man hardly over thirty years of age who has advanced through the various\n",
      "grades of work until he is now superintendent of the advertising\n",
      "department, receiving a remuneration of $7,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "997. GREAT DAILY EDITORS.--Editors of leading departments in our great\n",
      "dailies receive from $2,000 upward. Managing editors and\n",
      "editors-in-chief receive many times that sum. One man in the New York\n",
      "_Sun_ office has for his services a salary of $15,000, and besides this\n",
      "does outside literary work to the amount of $5,000 yearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "998. MEDICAL SPECIALISTS.--There is still “room at the top” of the\n",
      "medical world. The largest harvests are reaped by those who devote\n",
      "themselves to particular parts of the human framework, and at last are\n",
      "able to set up as “consulting physicians.” One doctor, whose apartments\n",
      "are crowded daily, informed the author of this work that he was treating\n",
      "eleven hundred and fifty patients. The celebrated Dr. Loomis for some\n",
      "time before his death made $50,000 a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "999. LEGAL COUNSELORS.--What is true of medicine is equally so of the\n",
      "law. Specialists in such branches as real estate, legacies, insurance,\n",
      "etc., are in receipt of immense revenue. Celebrated bar-pleaders also\n",
      "have grown rich. The names of Rufus and Joseph Choate, of Wm. Evarts\n",
      "and Ben. Butler, are examples of men who have received single fees of\n",
      "$10,000. One young lawyer says: “I began seven years ago and during this\n",
      "period my earnings, with their investments, amount to $200,000.” Legal\n",

      "which employ at a regular salary one or more attorneys.\n",

      "to $50,000; of insurance companies, there are at least three which pay\n",
      "their presidents $50,000; of railroad presidents, one receives $100,000,\n",

      "also the engineer of a large manufactory, who is paid $25,000. “Is not\n",
      "that high?” inquired a visitor at the works. “He is cheap for us,” was\n",
      "the reply, illustrating the truth that talent and skill are everywhere\n",
      "and always in demand. The concern could not afford to lose him to rival\n",

      "the leading occupations. In most cases the figures have been compiled\n",
      "from government reports, but where no reports could be obtained an\n",
      "estimate has been made by taking the average receipts from certain\n",
      "districts. In the latter instances, of course, the table cannot be\n",
      "considered perfectly reliable; this is especially the case with the\n",
      "professions of the lawyer, the doctor, and the clergyman. Still, as the\n",
      "sections of the country taken may be considered as fairly representative\n",
      "of the whole, the figures will probably be found not far amiss.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some persons will be surprised to learn the average lawyer and physician\n",
      "receive respectively only $1,210 and $1,053, but they should bear in\n",
      "mind that while the pay in these professions is sometimes as high as\n",
      "$25,000 and even $50,000 a year, a great number of beginners and\n",
      "unsuccessful men are toiling--or not toiling--for a mere pittance. Were\n",
      "it not for the ten per cent. of very successful men in these professions\n",
      "who are making fortunes, the average receipts would be even smaller by\n",
      "two or three hundred dollars than they appear in the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other cases where the figures may not have as much value as could be\n",
      "desired are under the headings which really comprise a group of\n",
      "occupations instead of a single one, as that of the journalist and the\n",
      "electrician; yet others where the general name is that of a genus\n",
      "comprising many species, as that of the engineer; and still others where\n",
      "there is a great difference in the value of the work performed, as in\n",
      "the case of teachers and factory operatives. Again, in business\n",
      "ventures, such as those of storekeepers, bankers, brokers, and others,\n",
      "many have actually lost money, and this reduces immensely the average,\n",
      "while among the so-called working classes, days of idleness, willing or\n",
      "enforced, operate in the same way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet, on the whole, if any one consults the table as a general guide to\n",
      "the pecuniary rewards of the various trades and professions, he will\n",
